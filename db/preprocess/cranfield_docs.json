        "text": " inviscid hypersonic flow over blunt-nosed slender bodies .   at hypersonic speeds the drag area of a blunt nose is much larger than the drag area of a slender afterbody, and the energy contained in the flow field in a plane at right angles to the flight direction is nearly constant over a downstream distance many times greater than the characteristic nose dimension .  the transverse flow field exhibits certain similarity properties directly analogous to the flow similarity behind an intense blast wave found by g. i. taylor, s. c. lin, and a. sakurai .  a comparison with the experiments of hammitt, vas, and bogdonoff on a flat plate with a blunt leading edge at in helium shows that the shock-wave shape is predicted very accurately by this similarity analysis .  the predicted surface pressure distribution is somewhat less satisfactory .  experimental results on a hemisphere-cylinder obtained at in the galcit air tunnel indicate that not only the shock-wave shape but also the surface pressures for this body are given very closely by the similarity theory, except near the hemisphere-cylinder junction .   energy considerations combined with a detailed study of the equations of motion show that flow similarity is also possible for a class of bodies of the form, provided that, where for a two-dimensional body and for a body of revolution .  when the shock shape is not similar to the body shape, and the entire flow field some distance from the nose must depend to some extent on the details of the nose geometry .   by again utilizing energy and drag considerations one finds that at hypersonic speeds the inviscid surface pressures generated by a blunt leading edge are larger than the pressures induced by boundary-layer growth on an insulated flat surface for an insulated blunt-nosed slender body of revolution the corresponding distance is given by .  (here is free-stream reynolds number based on leading-edge thickness, or nose diameter .)  in free flight these constants are replaced by 1,700 and 20, respectively, so that viscous interaction effects are important over the forward portion of a blunt- nosed slender body only for relatively low values of . however, /far downstream/ of the nose the inviscid over-pressure is small and viscous interaction phenomena will have to be taken into account .

        "text": " the gyroscopic effect of a rigid rotating propeller on engine and wing vibration modes .   in many wing vibration analyses it is found necessary to take into account the effect of flexibly mounted engines .  hence, it is reasonable to ask what vibratory gyroscopic effect this flexibility may give rise to when propellers are whirling .  an engine mount may be thought of as a horizontal beam cantilevered from the wing, having both horizontal and vertical flexibility . if this beam were infinitely rigid horizontally, then, when it vibrated, the gyroscopic moments induced in the propeller due to the resultant pitching motion of its axis would not produce propeller axis yaw .  however, engine-mount lateral stiffness tical stiffness, so that gyroscopic effects will play a role as the propeller axis undergoes pitching vibrations at the tip of the cantilever engine mount .  the purpose of this paper is to investigate this role under the assumption that the propeller itself is a rigid disc .   the paper is divided into four parts .  part (1) deals briefly with classical gyroscope theory .  part (2) presents engine vibration mode studies-experimental photographic techniques on a model gyroscope mounted at the ends of two different cantilever beams .  part (3) presents the theory of the coupled motion of an elastic wing upon which a gyroscope is mounted to simulate an engine-propeller system on an airplane .  part (4) consists of an example of the theory of part (3), in which, by taking what are thought to be reasonable parameters, results are obtained showing how the whirling of a rigid propeller may materially affect wing normal mode shapes and frequencies .

        "text": " tip-bluntness effects on cone pressures at m=6.85 . there is, at present, considerable interest in the characteristies of blunted bodies from both an aerodynamic and a heat-transfer standpoint .  the use of blunt shapes is contemplated to reduce the heat-transfer problem at body noses, but there are also applications for blunt noses which occur from mainly aerodynamic considerations .  an actual reduction in drag may be the beneficial result of blunting the nose of a cone or a similar slender shape under certain conditions .  although the sphere has received considerable treatment, the nose shapes are not necessarily tangent spheres .  in the case, let us say, of a total head tube situated in the nose of a given body, the blunting may be quite flat, and nose sections blunter than spherical shape may conceivably be desirable, in some cases, from the heat- transfer standpoint .   the purpose of the present investigation is to examine the aerodynamic effect of a simple type of nose blunting on a basic body . the incompressible flow of an electrically conducting fluid past a porous plate y = 0 with constant suction velocity in the presence of a transverse uniform strength has recently been investigated by gupta .  in this note, the problem is generalized to take into account the effect of free convection, when a body force g per unit mass is acting in the negative x-direction parallel to the wall .  the fluid is assumed to be semi- incompressible as usual .  in addition to the obvious practical significance, this problem is also interesting in the sense that it provides another exact solution of the magnetohydrodynamic equations, since the only electromagnetic assumptions involved are constant properties and freedom from excessive charges .

        "text": " temperature and velocity profiles in the compressible laminar boundary layer with arbitrary distribution of surface temperature .   an analysis is presented which enables the temperature profiles, veiocity profiles, heat transfer, and skin friction to be calculated for laminar flow over a two-dimensional or axially symmetric surface without pressure gradient but with an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature .  the general theory is applicable to a gas of any prandtl number, although the numerical results given herein have been computed for air . the predictions of the theory for the special case of constant surface temperature are compared with the calculations of crocco . on the basis of this comparison, it is inferred that the present theory enables heat-transfer and skin-friction calculations accurate to within about 5 per cent to be made for flight conditions up to mach numbers near 5 and to within about 1 or 2 per cent for supersonic wind-tunnel conditions up to considerably higher mach numbers .   a particular effort has been made to present the results, which are simple considering their generality, in a form that can be used readily in practical applications .  from the mathematical point of view, the theory is applicable to an arbitrary analytic distribution of surface temperature, but in any given practical case it is necessary that the surface-temperature distribution be approximated by a polynomial .  the only unknowns in the final equations developed are the coefficients of this polynomial, so that the work involved in applying the theory in any given case depends entirely on the work involved in approximating a given surface- temperature distribution by a polynomial .   an example is worked out in detail which illustrates some of the principal effects of variable surface temperature .  it is shown that both positively infinite and negatively infinite heat-transfer coefficients can occur .  the anomaly of infinite and negative heat-transfer coefficients is discussed and attributed to the customary definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, which is shown to be fundamentally inappropriate for flows with variable surface temperature .  in the particular example considered, a conventional method for calculating the net heat transferred yields completely incorrect results .  a brief qualitative discussion of the possible effects of the heat transfer on flow separation is given . in order to facilitate the use of the results, all of the principal equations developed are collected and summarized in the section entitled /practical use of results ./ ",

        "text": " investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary layer in a compressible fluid .   in the present report the stability of two-dimensional laminar flows of a gas is investigated by the method of small perturbations . the chief emphasis is placed on the case of the laminar boundary layer .   part 1 of the present report deals with the general mathematical theory .  the general equations governing one normal mode of the small velocity and temperature disturbances are derived and studied in great detail .  it is found that for reynolds numbers of the order of those encountered in most aerodynamic problems, the temperature disturbances have only a negligible effect on those particular velocity solutions which depend primarily on the viscosity coefficient (/viscous solutions/) .  indeed, the latter are actually of the same form in the compressible fluid as in the incompressible fluid, at least to the first approximation .  because of this fact, the mathematical analysis is greatly simplified .  the final equation determining the characteristic values of the stability problem depends on the /inviscid solutions/ and the function of tietjens in a manner very similar to the case of the incompressible fluid .  the second viscosity coefficient and the coefficient of heat conductivity do not enter the problem,. only the ordinary coefficient of viscosity near the solid surface is involved .   part 2 deals with the limiting case of infinite reynolds numbers . the study of energy relations is very much emphasized .  it is shown that the disturbance will gain energy from the main flow if the gradient of the product of mean density and mean vorticity near the solid surface has a sign opposite to that near the outer edge of the boundary layer .   a general stability criterion has been obtained in terms of the gradient of the product of density and vorticity, analogous to the rayleigh-tollmien criterion for the case of an incompressible fluid . if this gradient vanishes for some value of the velocity ratio of the main flow exceeding 1-1/m (where m is the free stream mach number) .

        "text": " a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles .   long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in unpowered flight .  powered flight is analyzed for an idealized propulsion system which rather closely approaches present-day rocket motors . unpowered flight is characterized by a return to earth along a ballistic, skip, or glide trajectory .  only those trajectories are treated which yield the maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight . aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner similar to that employed previously by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047), with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles .   the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the several types studied in the sense that it generally requires the highest velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range . this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat transfer to the re-entry body through the artifice of increasing pressure drag in relation to friction drag - that is, by using a blunt body .  thus the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved .   the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood of and greater than 4 is far superior to the ballistic vehicle in ability to convert velocity into range .  it has the disadvantage of having far more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage that this heat can in the main be radiated back to the atmosphere . consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low .   the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in converting velocity into range .  at lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to be about equal to comparable ballistic vehicles while at lift-drag ratios ",

        "text": " theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm .   the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of some effects due to variations of the glass properties .  the ballistic re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0.635 m, a ballistic factor of 3.5 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124.9 (from the vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4.5 . the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions for the problem .  as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight state are also given .  the discussions made it possible to derive under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields .   investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat, and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable .  a small thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high radiative heat transfer out of the shield,. and steep temperature profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across the shield with little total ablation of the shield .  results show that for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is the only material parameter affecting this thickness .   a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable,. although, these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely low viscosity level .

        "text": " discussion of solar proton events and manned space flights .   as a result of studies made during the international geophysical year (igy) and the international geophysical cooperation (igc), it is known that a considerable fraction of large solar flares give rise to almost pure streams of protons which reach the earth and continue to arrive for as long as 11 days . the energies of these particles lie within a very steep spectrum extending from 20 to least 500 mev .  because of the frequency of large flares during times of high solar activity, and owing to the long duration of each solar proton emission, these particles were present in detectable intensity near the top of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent of the time from 1957 to 1960 .  the number of large flares that accelerated and released these particles during this three-year period was about 30 .   the event that began on august 22, 1958 contributed greatly toward the understanding of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events, and in addition provided the first identification of the emitted particles .  a flare on may of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that this phenomenon was recognized as an additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles in the high atmosphere and in most parts of the solar system .  the three very intense events that occurred in july, 1959 further supported this conclusion, and the possibility of predicting such events became an important consideration .  in addition to its value in the protection of human beings, effective forecasting clearly would be of great value in the detailed scientific study of this phenomenon .   this paper presents a preliminary discussion of some aspects of predicting the arrival of protons at the earth following the appearance of solar activity features and, equally important, of forecasting the periods when this penetrating radiation is unlikely to occur .

        "text": " an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure field .   the present article describes an investigation of several types of separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and subsonic flow .  the conditions for the existence, the geometry, and the pressure field are described in this paper .   a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated regions .   it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion . this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent transition in the oncoming boundary layer,. in either laminar or turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and reynolds numbers .  a semiempirical correlation predicting the conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary depth is proposed .   detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be the pertinent similarity parameter .  for short notches the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction governs the pressure field .  the pressure in the cavity is nearly constant and can be higher than free-stream .  in long notches the shear layer bends inward at separation and curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point .  the floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure at reattachment is small .  the variation of the drag coefficient with mach number reflects the change from one to the other mechanism of recompression .   detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented and analyzed .  it is found that, in general, the assumptions of the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary .   results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial boundary layer (in the range of 0.3 to 3 times the notch depth) and of the geometry of the notch are also presented .

        "text": " the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary layer flow .   the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary-layer flow has been investigated, and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter which is essentially the ratio of the boundary-layer thickness to body radius .  it is shown that the busemann and crocco integrals of the two-dimensional energy equation for are still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse curvature effects are considered .  by a generalization of mangler's transformation it is then shown that the boundary-layer equations are reducible to an almost two-dimensional form, making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions characterized by and less than or of the order of unity . it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them from the two-dimensional form, behaves like an external favorable pressure gradient .   except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity but proportional to .  it is shown how the asymptotic solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the body shapes are given by and and (2) the velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external velocity of the form past a body given by .  the zeroth approximation is the mangler result .  for the cases of a linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found for all values of .  more generally it is shown that similar profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that . here, similar is used in the restricted meaning that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential equations .   in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient where the equations have been numerically integrated for, the first-order correction to the mangler formulation shows that the effect on both the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than or of the order of unity .  at a constant, the effects are increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to free-stream temperature, or mach number, is increased .  also, all other conditions being equal, for the same value of the skin-friction coefficient and heat-transfer increase on the cylinder is greater than that on the cone .   for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to delay both separation and transition when compared with axially symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is neglected .

        "text": " review of published data on the effect of roughness on transition from laminar to turbulent flow . a review is presented of the published data on the effect of roughness, especially single roughness elements, on transition from laminar to turbulent flow, in which an attempt is made to reanalyze and correlate the available information .  the reanalysis shows that the transition reynolds number of a flat plate with zero pressure gradient is a function of the ratio of the height of the roughness element to the displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element, this functional relation being a better representation of the data than a constant critical reynolds number of the roughness element .  other data show that the effects of roghness are similar in streams of different initial turbulence and that a plot of the ratio of transition reynolds number of the rough plate to that for the smooth plate against the ratio of the height of the roughness element to displacement thickness of the boundary layer at the element gives good correlation of all the data for a given shape when transition occurs downstream from the roughness element .  at a certain value of the height-thickness ratio dependent on the stream speed, location of roughness element, and airstream turbulence, the transition position reaches the element and remains there as the height or the stream speed is further increased . the paper also discusses available data on the effect of distributed roughness on transition on a flat plate, as well as some of the published data on roughness effects on transition on air-foils .

        "text": " vibration isolation of aircraft power plants . vibration in aircraft structure can almost always be traced to vibratory forces originating from the power plant .  these forces are transmitted to the aircraft in two ways ..  (1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance . vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure .  more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying .  the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned .   this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases .

        "text": " dynamics of a dissociating gas .   this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec . thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near equilibrium for transport properties and of large departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 .   following a survey of the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is characterized by only three constants, the characteristic temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation . physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational modes always just half excited (so that at low temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations are given for the isentropic changes that take place along streamlines between shocks .   various of these results are applied to the problem typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the limit for large values of both mach number and density ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body . the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that predicted by freeman's second approximation based on the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956), ",

        "text": " the determination of turbulent skin friction by means of pitot tubes .   a simple method of determining local turbulent skin friction on a smooth surface has been developed which utilises a round pitot tube resting on the surface . assuming the existence of a region near the surface in which conditions are functions only of the skin friction, the relevant physical constants of the fluid and a suitable length, a universal non-dimensional relation is obtained for the difference between the total pressure recorded by the tube and the static pressure at the wall, in terms of the skin friction .  this relation, on this assumption, is independent of the pressure gradient . the truth and form of the relation were first established, to a considerable degree of accuracy, in a pipe using four geometrically similar round pitot tubes--the diameter being taken as representative length .  these four pitot tubes were then used to determine the local skin friction coefficient at three stations on a wind tunnel wall, under varying conditions of pressure gradient .  at each station, within the limits of experimental accuracy, the deduced skin friction coefficient was found to be the same for each pitot tube, thus confirming the basic assumption and leaving little doubt as to the correctness of the skin friction so found .  pitot traverses were then made in the pipe and in the boundary layer on the wind tunnel wall .  the results were plotted in two non-dimensional forms on the basis already suggested and they fell close together in a region whose outer limit represented the breakdown of the basic assumption, but close to the wall the results spread out, due to the unknown displacement of the effective centre of a pitot tube near a wall .  this again provides further evidence of the existence of a region of local dynamical similarity and of the correctness of the skin friction deduced from measurements with round pitot tubes on the wind tunnel wall .  the extent of the region in which the local dynamical similarity may be expected to hold appears to vary from about to of the boundary-layer thickness for conditions remote from, and close to, separation respectively .

        "text": " supersonic flow past slender bodies with discontinuous profile slope .   ward's slender-body theory is extended to derive first approximations to the external forces on slender bodies of general cross section with discontinuous profile slope .  two classes of body are considered .. bodies whose profile (typified by the local radius) is continuous between the nose and base, and certain bodies whose profile is discontinuous, such as bodies with annular or side air intakes and wing-bodies on which the wing has an unswept leading edge .  (where air intakes are concerned, it is assumed that they are sharp-edged and that there is no /spillage/ of the internal flow) .   the following conclusions apply to the former class of bodies .  the variation of drag with mach number is found to depend only on the discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change of the cross-sectional area, and is thus independent of cross-sectional shape . the drag itself is unchanged if the direction of the flow is reversed .  the expressions for lift and moment assume the same forms as for smooth pointed bodies, the lift depending only on conditions at the base of the body .   the general theory is applied to winged bodies of revolution with an unswept wing leading edge ..  the results bear a marked resemblance to those obtained by ward .  the results for wings alone are seen to be applicable, with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .

        "text": " expansions at small reynolds number for the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder .   this paper is concerned with the problem of obtaining higher approximations to the flow past a sphere and a circular cylinder than those represented by the well-known solutions of stokes and oseen .  since the perturbation theory arising from the consideration of small non-zero reynolds numbers is a singular one, the problem is largely that of devising suitable techniques for taking this singularity into account when expanding the solution for small reynolds numbers .   the technique adopted is as follows .  separate, locally valid the regions close to, and far from, the obstacle .  reasons are presented for believing that these 'stokes' and 'oseen' expansions are, respectively, of the forms where are spherical or cylindrical polar coordinates made dimensionless with the radius of the obstacle, r is the reynolds number, and and vanish with r .  substitution of these expansions in the navier-stokes equation then yields a set of differential equations for the coefficients and, but only one set of physical boundary conditions is applicable to each expansion (the no-slip conditions for the stokes expansion, and the uniform-stream condition for the oseen expansion) so that unique solutions cannot be derived immediately .  however, the fact that the two expansions are (in principle) both derived from the same exact solution leads to a 'matching' procedure which yields further boundary conditions for each expansion .  it is thus possible to determine alternately successive terms in each expansion .   the leading terms of the expansions are shown to be closely related to the original solutions of stokes and oseen, and detailed results for some further terms are obtained .

        "text": " an analysis of the corridor and guidance requirements for supercircular entry planetary atmospheres .   an analysis is presented of supercircular entry into a planet's atmosphere giving particular attention to the corridor through which spacecraft must be guided in order to accomplish various maneuvers . a dimensionless parameter based on conditions at the conic perigee altitude is introduced for characterizing supercircular entries and conveniently prescribing corridor widths associated with elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic approach trajectories .  the analysis applies to vehicles of arbitrary weight, shape, and size .  illustrative calculations are made for venus, earth, mars, jupiter, and titan .   for nonlifting vehicles having fixed aerodynamic coefficients, curves are presented of dimensionless parameters from which can be calculated the maximum deceleration, maximum rate of laminar convective heating, and total laminar heat absorbed during single-pass entry at velocities up to twice circular velocity .  for lifting vehicles, curves are presented of the maximum deceleration and overshoot boundary of an entry corridor,. equations are presented for estimating laminar aerodynamic heating from the maximum deceleration .  it is shown that the corridor width is independent of vehicle weight, dimensions, and drag coefficient, provided these are the same at the overshoot boundary as at undershoot .  the corridors of certain planets can be broadened markedly by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for example, the 10-earth-g corridor width for single-pass, nonlifting, parabolic entry is increased from to 52, 51, and 52 miles, respectively, by employing a lift-drag ratio of 1 .  the use of aerodynamic lift does not increase appreciably the corridors of mars and titan .  all corridor widths decrease rapidly as the entry velocity is increased .   terminal guidance requirements on accuracy of velocity and flight path angle for successfully entering various corridors are compared with analogous requirements for putting a satellite into orbit, for hitting the moon from the earth, and for achieving icbm accuracy .  consideration is given to the terminal guidance problem involved in using a planet's atmosphere--rather than rocket fuel--to effect orbital transfers from heliocentric to planeto-centric motion, thereby converting a hyperbolic approach trajectory to an elliptic orbit about the target planet .  this fuel saving maneuver appears technologically feasible for certain planetary voyages, and implies the possibility of achieving a large reduction in required earth lift-off weight of chemical propulsion systems .

        "text": " an approximate analytical method for studying entry into planetary atmospheres .   the pair of motion equations for entry into a planetary atmosphere is reduced to a single, ordinary, nonlinear differential equation of second order by disregarding two relatively small terms and by introduring a certain mathematical transformation .  the reduced equation includes various terms, certain of which represent the gravity force, the centrifugal acceleration, and the lift force .  if these particular terms are disregarded, the differential equation is linear and yields precisely the solution of allen and eggers applicable to ballistic entry at relatively steep angles of descent .  if all the other terms in the basic equation are disregarded (corresponding to negligible vertical acceleration and negligible vertical component of drag force), the resulting truncated differential equation yields the solution of sanger for equilibrium flight of glide vehicles with relatively large lift-drag ratios .   a number of solutions for lifting and nonlifting vehicles entering at various initial angles also have been obtained from the complete nonlinear equation . these solutions are universal in the sense that a single solution determines the motion and heating of a vehicle of arbitrary weight, dimensions, and shape entering an arbitrary planetary atmosphere . one solution is required for each lift-drag ratio . these solutions are used to study the deceleration, heating rate, and total heat absorbed for entry into venus, earth, mars, and jupiter .  from the equations developed for heating rates, and from available information on human tolerance limits to acceleration stress, approximate conditions for minimizing the aerodynamic heating of a trimmed vehicle with constant lift-drag ratio are established for several types of manned entry .  a brief study is included of the process of atmosphere braking for slowing a vehicle from near escape velocity to near satellite velocity .

        "text": " skin-friction measurements in incompressible flow . experiments have been conducted to measure in incompressible flow the local surface-shear stress and the average skin-friction coefficient for a turbulent boundary-layer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient . the local surface-shear stress was measured by a floating-element skin-friction balance and also by a calibrated total head tube located on the surface of the test wall . the average skin-friction coefficient was obtained from boundary-layer velocity profiles . the boundary-layer profiles were also used to determine the location of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer . data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbers from 1 million to about 45 million with an attendant change in mach number from 0.11 to 0.32 .    the measured local skin-friction coefficients obtained with the floating-element balance agree well with those of schultz-grunow and kempf for reynolds numbers up to 45 million . the measured average skin-friction coefficients agree with those given by the schoenherr curve in the ranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 million and 30 to 45 million . in the range of reynolds numbers from 3 to 30 million the measured values are less than those predicted by the schoenherr        curve . the results show that the /univeral skin-friction constants/ proposed by coles appraoch asymptotically a constant value at reynolds numbers exceeding mentioned constants and the limited reynolds number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt as to the validity of any turbulent skin-friction law written on the basis of the present results . hence, no new friction law is proposed .    the frictional resistance of a flat plate was calculated by means of the momentum method and also the integrated measured local surface shear . for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million both methods give about the same result,. whereas at lower values of reynolds number the momentum method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for the effects of turbulence results in a frictional resistance as much as 4 percent higher than that of the integrated shear . the measurement of local surface shear by a calibrated preston tube appears to be accurate and inexpensive . the calibration as given by preston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield the results obtained from the floating-element skin-friction balance .

(1) the navier-stokes equations are adequate for the description of the shock transition for initial mach numbers up to 2, and (2) the effects of rotational relaxation times in air can be accounted for by the introduction of a /second/ or /bulk/ viscosity coefficient equal to about two-thirds of the ordinary shear viscosity .

        "text": " some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody combination .   the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsion-system installations have assumed a role of vital importance in the development of supersonic aircraft .  although air-induction systems have received moderate attention in the literature, considerably less information can be found on the design and installation of turbojet exit nozzles .  this condition should not be interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jet-exit design .   as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations which are efficient over the entire speed range .  the difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always compatible .  in many of the compromise solutions, it is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle and afterbody performance .  rather they must be treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet interaction with the external stream must be taken into account .  to accomplish this, the nozzle and air-frame designers must closely coordinate their efforts .   some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle afterbody combinations are outlined in this report . particular attention is devoted to the influence of the jet-stream interaction on both nozzle thrust and after-body drag .  for this purpose, use is made of shock- boundary-layer-interaction concepts .  this approach, although not precise, correctly predicts many trends and is generally enlightening .

        "text": " some possibilities of using gas mixtures other than in aerodynamic research . a study is made of the advantages that can be realized in compressible-flow research by employing a substitute heavy gas in place of air . most heavy gases considered in previous investigations are either toxic, chemically active, or (as in the case of the freons) have a ratio of specific heats greatly different from air .  the present report is based on the idea that by properly mixing a heavy monatomic gas with a suitable heavy polyatomic gas, it is possible to obtain a heavy gas mixture which has the correct ratio of specific heats and which is nontoxic, nonflammable, thermally stable, chemically inert, and comprised of commercially available components . calculations were made of wind-tunnel characteristics for 63 gas pairs comprising 21 different polyatomic gases properly mixed with each of three monatomic gases (argon, krypton, and xenon) .  for a given mach number, reynolds number, and tunnel pressure, a gas-mixture wind tunnel having the same specific-heat ratio as air would be appreciably smaller and would require much less power than a corresponding air wind tunnel .  analogous though different advantages can be realized in compressor research and in firing-range research . the most significant applications, perhaps, arise through selecting and proportioning a gas mixture so as to have at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures certain dimensionless characteristics which air at flight temperatures possesses but which air at ordinary wind-tunnel temperatures does not possess .  characteristics which involve the relaxation time (or bulk viscosity), the variation of viscosity with temperature, and the variation of specific heat with temperature fall within this category .  other applications arise in heat-transfer research since certain gas mixtures can be concocted to have any prandtl number in the range at least between 0.2 and 0.8 .

        "text": " a theory for the core of a leading edge vortex .   in the flow past a slender delta wing at incidence can be observed a roughly axially symmetric core of spiralling fluid, formed by the rolling up of the shear layer that separates from a leading edge .  the aim in this report is to predict the flow field within this vortex core, given appropriate conditions at its outside edge .   the basic assumptions are core . in addition it is assumed that the flow is axially symmetric and incompressible . together, these admit outer and inner solutions for the core from the equations of motion .   for the outer solution the sub-core is ignored, and the flow is taken to be inviscid (but rotational) and conical . the resulting solution consists of simple expressions for the velocity components and pressure .  for the inner solution, which applies to the diffusive sub-core, the flow is taken to be laminar, and approximations, some based on the boundary conditions and some analogous to those of boundary layer theory, are made .  the solution obtained in this case is a first approximation, and is presented in tabular form .   a sample calculation yields results which are in good qualitative and fair quantitative agreement with experimental measurements .

        "text": " pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range .   this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  the effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is also included .   the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 . the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .   an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical approximations .   a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the body .   the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a mach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause a small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .

        "text": " propeller in yaw .   it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw develops a side force like that of a fin .  in 1917, r. g. harris expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the unyawed propeller .  of several attempts to express the side force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none has been completely satisfactory .  an analysis that incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide range of operating conditions is presented herein .  the present analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may be taken as the projected side area of the propeller .  the effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by the inflow .  the variation of the inflow velocity, for a fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force with advance-diameter ratio v nd .   the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the exception of the spin .   further conclusions are ..  a dual-rotating propeller in yaw develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating propeller .  a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a pitching moment in addition to the side force .  the pitching moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the propeller radius .  this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw is small but possibly not negligible .   the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been presented without derivation in an earlier report .

        "text": " theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic turbines .   in special circumstances where a large work output is required from a turbine in a single stage it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at inlet to the rotor .  as part of an investigation into such turbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of the rotor have been tested in a two-dimensional tunnel, a design theory being developed concurrently .   the first design, featuring constant passage width and curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from focusing of the compression waves from the concave surface, with consequent flow separation from the opposite convex surface .  it gave a velocity coefficient of measured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning angle of 140 deg .  the measured value compares favourably with values from previous steam tests, where the results have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92 .   from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test observations, a subsequent passage was designed having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading to a free-vortex passage of double the transition curvature,. a small amount of contraction was incorporated . schlieren photographs showed the flow in this passage to be almost shock free .  a thin region of low-energy air existed close to the convex surface, but liquid-injection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow . pressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity coefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressure . when allowance is made for turning angle and reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably with previous work .   it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a two-dimensional cascade .  however, the resultant pitching tends to become very close, except at very large turning angles, with the result that in some applications difficulties could arise in the practical design and manufacture .   several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded as still experimental .

        "text": " the supersonic axial flow compressor .   an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into the blade rows .  preliminary calculations showed that very high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat increased mass flows, were apparently possible with compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their blading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has been reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound . the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow compressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies, large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which extend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient is apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is proposed .   as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of the encouraging results of this study, an experimental single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in freon-12 .  in this compressor, air decelerates through the speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at subsonic speeds .  a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency of about 80 percent has been obtained .

(1) near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately increasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greater than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching similarity .  (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with distance from the jet nozzle .  (3) farther downstream of the jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases approximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle the lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about mum moves out from the centerline .

        "text": " on the strength distribution of noise sources along a jet .   the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is investigated by application of lighthill's theory to regions of 'similar' profiles .  the analysis refers to the noise power emitted by a 'slice' of jet (section between two adjacent planes normal to the axis) as a function of distance x of the slice from the nozzle . it is found that this power is essentially constant with x in the initial mixing region (x law), then further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters from the nozzle) falls off extremely fast (x law or faster) in the fully developed jet .  because of this striking attenuation of strength with distance, it is concluded that the mixing region produces the bulk of the noise and must dominate in muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat' part of the jet must contribute much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed .   powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity profile on total noise power are interpreted qualitatively .  the behavior of multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers, both as to overall quieting and frequency-shifting, is also interpreted in the light of the results .  the possibility emerges that such mufflers may be improved without serious thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .

        "text": " elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds .   to help fill the gap in the knowledge of aerodynamics of shapes intermediate between bodies of revolution and flat triangular wings, force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones have been experimentally determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6 and with lengths and base areas equal to circular cones of fineness ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied for angles of bank of 0 and 90 . elliptic and circular cones in combination with triangular wings of aspect ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been considered .  the angle-of-attack range was from 0 to about 16, and the reynolds number was 8x10, based on model length .  in addition to the forces and moments at angle of attack, pressure distributions for elliptic cones at zero angle of attack have been determined .   the results of this investigation indicate that there are distinct aerodynamic advantages to the use of elliptic cones .  with their major cross-sectional axes horizontal, they develop greater lift and have higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones of the same fineness ratio and volume . in combination with triangular wings of low aspect ratio, they also develop higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones with the same wings .  for winged elliptic cones, this increase in lift-drag ratio results both from lower zero-lift drag and drag due to lift .  visual-flow studies indicate that, because of better streamlining in the crossflow plane, vortex flow is inhibited more for an elliptic cone with major axis in the plane of the wing than for a circular cone with the same wing .  as a result, vortex drag resulting from lift is reduced . shifts in center of pressure with changes in angle of attack and mach number are small and about the same as for circular cones .   comparisons of theoretical and experimental force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones indicate that simple linearized (flat plate) wing theory is generally adequate even for relatively thick cones . zero-lift pressure distributions and drag can be computed using van dyke's second-order slender-body theory . for winged circular cones, a modification of the slender-body theory of naca rep. 962 results in good agreement of theory with experiment .

        "text": " interference between the wings and tail plane of a slender wing-body tailplane combination .   an approximate method of predicting the interference between the wings and the tailplane of a slender wing-body-tailplane combination in an inviscid flow is developed, in order to explain the change in centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found to occur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weapons .  incidence changes in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wings and the tail surfaces, have been considered .   the method is based on slender body theory and the assumption that the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reach the tailplane,. it is, therefore, applicable to weapons equipped with low aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaces .  when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, an analytical solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on the tail lift .  for high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces it is suggested by comparison with experimental data, that the tail lift may be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwash angle across the tail span .   a summary of the method is given in para.5 which, in conjunction with the introduction, may be read independently of the rest of the report .

        "text": " an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation of airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high reynolds numbers . and rapid method by which boundary layer flow was rendered visible has been previously described in the journal of the royal aeronautical society .  it gave promise of being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided a denser smoke could be obtained, which at the same time was free from the troublesome deposits associated with the wood smoke . of the aerodynamics division attempts were made by the fuel research station to improve the density of the wood smoke and to reduce the deposits .  these they showed were conflicting requirements, and whilst some improvement was effected, it was not sufficient for observation in the new tunnels at high speeds .   the staff of the director-general of scientific research and development, ministry of supply, was then approached and it was decided to develop an oil smoke generator from a simple generator of this type which was demonstrated to us .  this has been done successfully . the final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke generator is light and compact .  it takes only a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired . improvement on the wood smoke both as regards density and freedom from deposits, which cause premature transition .  the density and quality of the smoke are now under control .  smokes ranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour to a heavy smoke dense white in appearance can be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the advantages of the wood smoke in that it is non-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be tolerated even when it is present in a considerable concentration .  a certain amount of condensation is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable precautions troubles arising from this can be avoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a hard wax was successfully generated with the same apparatus .  unfortunately because of its flocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid deposits when passed through bore tubing, leading eventually to complete blockage .  this seems to be a feature of solid smokes .   the apparatus has been used to determine transition and laminar separation points on model wings in a number of the national physical laboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been maintained in the laminar state up to wind speeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels .   there is much to be said for making a standard practice of visualising boundary layer flow on models, particularly as the technique is simple and rapid .  it would greatly assist the interpretation of force measurements and the more detailed explorations of the boundary layer by total head tubes and hot wires .   the use of oil smoke is not limited to boundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus described in this report would seem to be particularly suited for educational work in small demonstration tunnels .

        "text": " the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year .  the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space .  the practical question which required an answer was ..  would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm  this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated .   an ideal problem is here discussed .  a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form .  the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated .  it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air .   the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front .  as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm",

        "text": " oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory .   the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles .   boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) . transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on the model surface .   the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .   the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary- layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000 based on local external properties and a distance along the body surface from the stagnation point) .   the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .

        "text": " an investigation of laminar transitional and turbulent heat transfer on blunt-nosed bodies in hypersonic flow .   laminar, transitional, and turbulent heating rates have been measured by means of the shrouded model technique .  the reynolds number was varied over a ninefold range,. the enthalpy ratio (stagnation to wall) varied from 2.3 to approximately 1.5 . two different pressure distributions were imposed on the model which consisted of a spherically capped cone .   the experimental data are compared to the laminar hypersonic boundary-layer theory and shown to be in good agreement on the conical portion of the model .  on the spherical portion the data are approximately 20 per cent higher than the theoretical prediction .  some of this discrepancy can be attributed to radiation to the nose of the model .   the fully developed turbulent heat-transfer data are compared to two theories ..  (1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/ conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more accurate .   for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional heat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions .   the behavior of transition reynolds number based on momentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative agreement with recent shock-tube measurements .

        "text": " first-order approach to a strong interaction problem in hypersonic flow over an insulated flat plate .   the present paper concerns with the strong interaction phenomenon over an insulated semi-infinite flat plate with a sharp leading edge .  in particular the main interest is in the consistent treatment in which the boundary-layer solution may be joined continuously with the inviscid solution regarding flow variables including pressure, normal velocity, temperature (or streamwise velocity) and density .   it is shown that the behavior of the inviscid solution may be consistent with that of the boundary-layer solution to at least first-order approximation that is correct to the order of, where m is the mach number of undisturbed flow, r the reynolds number based on the distance from leading edge and the ratio of specific heats .  then the first-order boundary-layer problem is formulated under such an external circumstance and an attempt is made for arriving at the solution .   actual calculations are carried out for both cases of air and helium .  from the solution it is found that the region in which the viscous effect plays a significant role is ranged over from 0 to a certain finite value of n, say n, in terms of the similarity coordinate n in the corresponding incompressible boundary layer . the numerical results moreover indicate that the induced pressure is considerably smaller than the estimate of lees (7) obtained by his approximate method in which the effect of the first-order induced pressure on the boundary layer is ignored and no survey of the first-order boundary-layer equation is made . the present results are also found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data recently obtained in helium flow by erickson (15) .

        "text": " various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow .   this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply .   results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities .   in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction .   for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation .   results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease .   calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy .   for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory .   a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations . qualitative agreement is indicated .

        "text": " a method for analysing the insulating properties of the laminar compressible boundary layer .   in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip, and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes, wings, and bodies of high-speed aircraft and missiles .   in this paper a method for investigating the insulating properties of a laminar compressible boundary layer on a two- dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream surface .   the karman integral method extended to both the momentum and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum, and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles .  thus the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree polynomials .  the resulting two integral-differential equations are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along the wall .  these two functions are related to the boundary-layer thickness and to the wall temperature .  initial conditions corresponding to a given initial wall temperature and an initial boundary-layer thickness are prescribed .  exact closed-form solutions for the case of zero axial pressure gradient are obtained .  for flows with significant pressure gradients, numerical solutions are required in general .  several numerical examples of practical interest are presented .

        "text": " on the stability of two dimensional parallel flows .   this is the last part of the author's theory of the stability of plane laminar motion .  (for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .) the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in detail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion of stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds number is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical significance is carefully discussed .   the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called neutral curve for the two characteristic types of velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and the symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the neutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two branches of the neutral curve approach and for profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile without a flex .  the most important results are as follows . for sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined .   the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good .   a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper .

        "text": " analytic study of induced pressure on long bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntness at hypersonic speeds .   a systematic study of induced pressures on a series of bodies of revolution with varying nose bluntness has been made by using the method of characteristics for a perfect gas .  the fluid mediums investigated were air and helium and the mach number range was from 5 to 40 .  a study of representative shock shapes was also made .  flow parameters obtained from the blast-wave analogy gave good correlations of induced pressures and shock shapes .  the induced-pressure correlations yielded empirical equations for air and helium which cover the complete range of nose bluntness considered .  (nose fineness ratios varied from 0.4 to 4.)  available experimental results were in good agreement with the characteristics solutions .  properties connected with the concept of hypersonic similitude enabled correlations of the calculations to be made with respect to nose shape, mach number, and ratio of specific heats .

        "text": " an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed cones at a mach number of 5. 8.   shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles of yaw from 0 to 8 .  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8, and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution .   the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow shock .  cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and over the conical afterbody .  on the 40 spherical nosed cone models the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value .  for models with smaller cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was approached more gradually .  the shape of the pressure distributions as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 .   integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll theory for sharp cones .

        "text": " application of two dimensional vortex theory to the prediction of flow fields behind wings of wing-body combinations at subsonic and supersonic speeds .   a theoretical investigation has been made of a general method for predicting the flow field behind the wings of plane and cruciform wing and body combinations at transonic or supersonic speeds and slender configurations at subsonic speeds .  the wing trailing-vortex wake is represented initially by line vortices distributed to approximate the spanwise distribution of circulation along the trailing edge of the exposed wing panels .  the afterbody is represented by corresponding image vortices within the body .  two-dimensional line-vortex theory is then used to compute the induced velocities at each vortex and the resulting displacement of each vortex is determined by means of a numerical stepwise integration procedure .  the method was applied to the calculation of the position of the vortex wake and the estimation of downwash at chosen tail locations behind triangular-wing and cylindrical-body combinations at supersonic speeds .  the effects of such geometric parameters as aspect ratio, angle of attack and incidence, ratio of body radius to wing semi-span, and angle of bank on the vortex wake behind wings of wing-body combinations were studied . the relative importance of wing vortices, the corresponding image vortices within the body, and body crossflow indetermining the the total downwash was assessed at a possible tail location .   it was found that the line-vortex method of this report permitted the calculation of vortex paths behind wings of wing-body combinations with reasonable facility and accuracy .  a calculated sample wake shape agreed qualitatively with one observed experimentally, and sample results of the line-vortex method compared well with an available exact crossflow-plane solution .  an empirical formula was derived to estimate the number  of vortices required per wing panel for a satisfactory computation of downwash at tail locations .  it was found that the shape of the vortex wake and the ultimate number of rolled-up vortices behind a wing depend on the circulation distribution along the wing trailing edge .  for the low-aspect-ratio plane wing and body combinations considered, it appeared that downwash at horizontal tail locations is largely determined except near the tail-body juncture by the wing vortices alone for small ratios of body radius to wing semispan, and by the body upwash alone for large values of that ratio .

(a) the correlation of pressure distributions on bodies having nonspherical noses involves interpretive modifications of the law suggested by blast wave analogy .  also shocks about these bodies are not described by parabolae,. (b) for all configurations there is substantial influence of gas behavior on shock shape,. this, however, can be correlated in terms of the gas conditions along a generally defined streamline,. (c) the shock layer can generally be divided into two regions (the first bound by the body and the aforementioned streamline, the second delimited by this streamline and the shock) wherein flow properties can either be approximated by simple laws or correlated ..  (d) for each configuration knowledge of the complete flow field in one flight condition (even pertaining to ideal gas flow) can be used to estimate features of flows under general flight conditions including those where equilibrium dissociation is encountered .

        "text": " on the solution of the laminar boundary layer equations .   the theory of the laminar boundary layer offers a means of determining the skin friction under the assumption of a given velocity distribution outside the boundary layer .  owing to the mathematical difficulties, however, exact solutions are possible only when the velocity distribution is expressed as a simple function of the distance along the surface .  more complicated velocity distributions necessitate recourse to the method of expansion in series or that of step-by-step calculations, but the labor involved is too great for the methods to be of practical use .  approximate method due to pohlhausen (1921), which had long been recommended for general use, gives a reasonably accurate solution in a region of accelerated flow, but recently its adequacy in a region of retarded flow has been questioned .  separation of flow may actually occur where the solution of pohlhausen fails to give it .  more recently howarth solution, which gives fairly reasonable results in a region of retarded flow .   howarth's solution essentially consists in solving the boundary layer equations for the particular case in which the velocity u outside the boundary layer decreases linearly with the distance x measured along the surface, and utilizing the solution by replacing the actual distribution of u by a circumscribing polygon of infinitesimal sides . therefore, it is assumed that the velocity distribution at any section depends on the velocity gradient du/dx at that section only, being affected by the conditions upstream only in so far as this affects the momentum thickness 0 .  in other words, the velocity distribution across the boundary layer is determined by a parameter .

        "text": " flow studies on flat plate delta wings at supersonic speeds .   an experimental study has been made to investigate some aspects of the nature of the flow around delta wings .  vapor-screen, pressure-distribution, and ink-flow studies were made at a mach number of 1.9 on a series of semispan delta-wing models with slender wedge airfoil sections and very sharp leading edges .  the models had semiapex angles ranging from 5 to 31.75 .   separated regions of vorticity existed along the chords of all the wings in the series tested .  concentrated vortex cores were found only on wings of very small semiapex angles .  for wings with medium and large semiapex angles, the separated vorticity was concentrated in a region extending over the outboard part of the span and lying close to the wing upper surface .   the results show that theoretical aerodynamic calculations, such as those in naca tn 3430, utilizing a single, separated vortex pair above the wing upper surface to represent the separated vorticity can be applied at supersonic speeds for very slender wings .

        "text": " the influence of two-dimensional stream shear for airfoil maximum lift .   the effects of stream velocity gradients on airfoil maximum lift are defined with experimental data obtained in a simulated two-dimensional slipstream .  the experimental results show that when positioned near the slipstream plane of symmetry, the airfoil maximum lift varies markedly with location in the slipstream .  in moving the airfoil from above to below the slipstream plane of symmetry through a total distance corresponding to the airfoil thickness, force data and boundary-layer observations show that boundary-layer separation is delayed to higher angles of attack, and the airfoil maximum lift is doubled .   it is concluded that the destalling effect observed in the non-uniform slipstream is not associated with slipstream boundary interference, but stems from the influence of the large local slipstream shear on airfoil characteristics .  the effects of uniform and nonuniform shear on airfoil lift and pressure distribution are discussed, within the framework of existing first-order, small-shear theory, to show that these effects of shear tend to promote stall .  a pohlhausen calculation of the laminar boundary layer in a stream with shear is used to identify and to assess the effects of stream shear on boundary-layer separation criteria .  it is demonstrated that these effects are negligibly small, and that the uniform-flow criterion applies .  it is concluded on the basis of the experimental data that the observed destalling phenomenon stems from a shear effect of higher order than those treated in the inviscid theories .  it is hypothesized that it is a second-order effect, fixed by the product of the stream shear and the derivative of the shear, which was large in the present experiments .

        "text": " a closed-form solution for the oscillations of a vehicle entering a planetary atmosphere .   author considers the equation of the yawing motion of a missile, derived with a series of customary assumptions and with the distance traveled as the independent variable .  his assumptions include the linearity of the aerodynamic forces, the constancy of the aerodynamic coefficients with respect to mach number, the absence of spin, and the absence of gravity .  if to these assumptions one could add the common ballistic assumption of a constant air density, the coefficients of this equation would have been con-damped sinusoids .  in ballistics any slow variation of these coefstant, and the solution would have been simply the exponentially-ficients is usually treated by adding an approximate correction term to the damping rate (which is spoken of as the wkb perturbation) .  however, with a body entering the planetary atmosphere the variation of the air density is apparently of greater essence (this is a point not stated explicitly in this brief communication), and the equation is of the type . the author shows that with a series of further transformations the equation can be reduced to the form the solutions of which are confluent hypergeometric functions .  these functions are defined as series involving gamma functions, and with a series of further assumptions can be reduced to laguerre polynomials and bessel functions .   it is certainly nice to have an exact solution to a problem which has heretofore been extensively treated by approximations and by the numerical approach .  this reviewer is puzzled, however, as to the practical significance of the proposed approach .  an idealization is of value in that it facilitates our understanding,. and the numerical approach, in that it allows refinements of the problem, freeing us from the necessity of idealizing .  but the proposed solution is certainly more difficult to refine than the original problem,. and it is certainly not simple (the solution of the original equation is not the value of z, but the various /reverse/ transformations of z) .  an evaluation of a series in practice must compete with the numerical approach,. and the equation suggested is of the zero) .  viewing the problem /afresh/ (in the light of the / computer revolution/ and without the constraints imposed by the prior art), it seems at least equally easy to /standardize/ the solutions of the original equation .

        "text": " wing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effects on a finned missile .   wing-tail interference is shown to cause large /magnus/ effects on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron setting .  a simple experimental method with water as the working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling missile .  the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with all-movable wings and fixed tail fins .  magnus data are presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the wings .  tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction, thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due to wing-tail interference .   a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental data .  a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is introduced to predict tail-interference factors .  good agreement with the data is obtained .   this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either that effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins . wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate only modifies the basic interference mechanism .

        "text": " laminar, transitional and turbulent heat transfer to a cone-cylinder-flare body at mach 8. 0.   an experimental investigation of the laminar, transitional, and turbulent heat transfer rates over a conical cylindrical flared body is presented .  regions of favorable, zero, and adverse pressure gradient on the body are investigated .  the experimental results are compared with the theories available in the literature .   the model chosen for this investigation is a cone-cylinder-flare configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body and terminated by a smooth large radius flare .   the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over a range of reynolds number from 0.3 x 10 to 1.6 x 10 per inch based on free stream conditions .  various stagnation-to-wall temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to the test with liquid nitrogen .  the stagnation-to-wall temperature ratios were 10 and 3.3 .   the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder and forward portion of the cylindrical body .  over the aft portion of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only qualitatively correct, and underestimate the heating rate by a factor as high as 3 .  conversely, the /flat plate reference enthalpy/ over the aft portion of the body, but to increasingly overestimate the heating rates over the forward portion of the cylinder .   a modified equation for the heat transfer coefficient in the transitional and fully turbulent region based on the f.p.r.e. method is then presented .  this method gives good agreement with the experimental results presented over the entire range of transitional and turbulent flow .   from the results the following is concluded ..  cooling the wall delayed transition .  by expanding the flow rapidly between the cone and the cylinder, the transition reynolds number is reached very rapidly .  by making a smooth transition between the cylinder and the flare, no separation occurred at the cylindrical flare junction .  the transitional and turbulent heat transfer in the presence of an adverse pressure gradient may be predicted with sufficient accuracy by the f.p.r.e. method .

        "text": " a theoretical study of the effect of upstream transpiration-cooling on the heat transfer and skin friction characteristics of a compressible laminar boundary layer .   an analysis is presented which predicts the skin-friction and heat-transfer characteristics of a compressible, laminar boundary layer on a solid flat plate preceded by a porous section that is transpiration cooled . the analysis is restricted to a prandtl number of unity and linear variation of viscosity with temperature .   the local skin friction has been found to have a low value in the region of transpiration cooling and then to increase until it approaches the value for a completely nonporous surface asymptotically .  the initial increase in local skin friction is rapid as half of the ultimate increase occurs in a distance beyond the porous region that is about 20 percent of the length of the porous region for all rates of injection .  when the total coolant flow rate is kept constant and the porous length is varied, it is found that the average skin friction on a partially porous plate is slightly lower than that on a fully porous plate .   the local heat transfer behaves in a manner similar to that of the local skin friction .  it is found, in an example, that the temperature at the end of a partially porous plate could be maintained at about the same temperature as a fully porous plate by doubling the total rate of coolant flow .

        "text": " concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar boundary layers and their separation .   the theory of compressible flow in a laminar boundary layer has been developed for the case when the viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the absolute temperature and the prandtl number is unity .  (these assumptions may be compared with the empirical relations suggested by cope .) it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate normal to the layer can lead to a simplified form of equation of motion very similar to the ordinary incompressible equation but modified by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure term .  this factor is greater than unity at the boundary and tends to one at the outside of the layer .   several particular solutions are considered including accelerated flow with a linearly increasing velocity and retarded flow along a flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity .   the general implications of the theory are discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn when the mainstream velocity starts from a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and subsequently falls .  it is concluded that for such a velocity distribution increasing compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase the boundary layer thickness and cause earlier separation as compared with the incompressible flow with the same mainstream velocity distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding to conditions at the stagnation point .

        "text": " the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer .   after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent boundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear combination of two universal functions .  one is the well-known law of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, is characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment . these functions are considered to be established empirically, by a study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any hypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resulting complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field, the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data .   the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly represents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the constraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile is modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is provided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetrates the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow and in the logarithmic profile near the wall .   finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions, considered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wall component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied, is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .

        "text": " atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle . the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is  considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section .  an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of  conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted, then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from equilibrium . it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected  by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated  to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing occurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more sensitive to departures from equilibrium .

        "text": " compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled . an analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means of a simplified stage-stacking study .  the principal problems considered were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor surge or stall-limit characteristics . the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages . such discontinuities can be due to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting from stall of adjacent stages .   the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin . furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abrupt-stall characteristics .   the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to part-speed compressor performance . these characteristics must, however, be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor . alleviation of part-speed operation problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage- loading margin .   the results of this analysis are only qualitative . the trends obtained, however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design problem . in addition to these stage-matching studies, a general discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable blades is included .

        "text": " some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors . observations of rotating stall have shown that a wide variety of stall patterns is possible .      hot-wire anemometer data on a multistage compressor have shown a progressive-type stall at low speeds . the amplitude of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the latter stages . a stage-stacking analysis has shown that rotating stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with compressor surge at high speeds .      blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage compressors .       in the stage-stacking analysis no deterioration of stage performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages was considered . in general, the pressure drop at the stall point is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical formulation of compressor performance . compressor surge is attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in jet-engine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic characteristics of compressor surge . in this event, engine operation will be limited because of the large drop in performance which accompanies compressor stall  .

        "text": " aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivatives for slender bodies of general cross section .   the problem of determining the total forces, moments, and stability derivatives for a slender body performing slow maneuvers in a compressible fluid is treated within the assumptions of slender-body theory .  general expressions for the total forces (except drag) and moments are developed in terms of the geometry and motions of the airplane, and formulas for the stability derivatives are derived in terms of the mapping functions of the cross sections .   all components of the motion are treated simultaneously and second derivatives as well as first are obtained, with respect to both the motion components and their time rates of change .  coupling of the longitudinal and lateral motions is thus automatically included .  a number of general relationships among the various stability derivatives are found which are independent of the configuration, so that, at most, only 35 of a total of 325 first and second derivatives need be calculated directly .  calculations of stability derivatives are carried out for two triangular wings with camber and thickness, one with a blunt trailing edge, and for two wing-body combinations, one having a plane wing and vertical fin .   the influence on the stability derivatives of the squared terms in the pressure relation is demonstrated, and the apparent mass concept as applied to slender-body theory is discussed at some length in the light of the present analysis .  it is shown that the stability derivatives can be calculated by apparent mass although the general expressions for the total forces and moments involve additional terms .

        "text": " calculation of the flow past slender delta wings with leading edge separation .   the flow past a slender delta wing with a sharp leading edge, at incidence, usually separates along this edge, i.e. a vortex layer extends from the edge and rolls up to form a /core/ (a region of high vorticity) . a potential flow model of this is constructed in which the layer is replaced by a vortex sheet which is rolled up into a spiral in the region of the /core/ .  this problem is reduced to a two-dimensional one by assuming a conical field and using slender wing theory .  the shape and strength of the sheet are determined by the two conditions that it is a stream surface and sustains no pressure difference .  use is made of results previously obtained for the core region and the remaining finite part of the sheet is dealt with by choosing certain functions for its shape and strength .  the parameters in these functions are found by satisfying the two conditions stated above at isolated points .  results are obtained for the pressure distribution, chord loading and norman force coefficient as functions of the ratio of the incidence to the apex angle .  the lift for a given incidence is about 15 below that found by brown and michael .  flow patterns are indicated in two typical cases .  the effect of separation on the drag due to lift of a wing with small thickness is discussed .

        "text": " scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite orbits . the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of the rate at which air density p varies with height y, being given by h-p//dp/dy/ . the value of h, although important because/with the molecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has not as yet been well determined at heights above 200 km . this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a satellite's perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital period of a satellite in a small-eccentricity orbit . these methods are then applied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose . the 44  values of h obtained, for heights of 200-450 km, represent an average over day and night and probably have errors/s.d./of 5-10( . it is found that, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreased greatly ..e.g.at height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to height becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the  supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km, for 1959-61 . the results could be greatly extended in scope and improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for short-lifetime satellites .

        "text": " the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue . the design of structures to resist jet noise fatigue demands a knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one hand to metal physics at the other . at the present time the various aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made . never- the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of construction in noise environments can be used with a limited amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of structure . this approach to the problem is adopted in this lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the moment . it must be emphasized, however, that although some progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if one is to prove the integrity of the design .      within the structural limits of single skin construction set in this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet .      the most resonable basis for the future estimation of fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the necessary test data .      the life expectation of a new design will be uncertain and some proof testing is essential if the integrity of structure in high noise levels (150 db) is to be guaranteed .

        "text": " a study of the cantilever square plate subjected to a uniform loading .   plate problems involving free edges have been historically difficult to solve, particularly when two free edges are adjacent, resulting in a free corner .  the cantilevered square plate subjected to a transverse loading is one such problem for which an exact solution has not been achieved .   in the present paper results obtained by various approximate methods are presented for this problem for the case of a uniform loading .  solutions obtained by the authors using the technique of point matching and the rayleigh-ritz method are compared with previously published finite-difference and experimental results and with bernoulli-euler beam and plane-strain approaches . numerical results for deflections, slope components, bending and twisting moments, and transverse distributed shears are presented for a relatively fine gridwork of points on the plate boundary and within the interior .  the antielastic curvature is exhibited by all methods except beam theory .  all methods present the interesting conclusion that the free edge deflection is greater when the plate is treated as a plate rather than a beam .

(1) small temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant- and along a variable-temperature wall, and (2) large temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant-temperature wall .   dimensionless forms of heat-transfer and friction parameters and boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated . the results indicate that coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall temperature ratios diminished the friction and heat transfer for a constant wall temperature .  for a variable wall temperature with small temperature differences in the boundary layer, the friction was unaffected, but the heat transfer was greatly increased for increased wall-temperature gradient .  heat-transfer results in the literature reveal that transpiration cooling is much more effective for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .

        "text": " theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers .   the effect of a strong, negative pressure gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on the isothermal surface of an electrically heated, cylindrical body of revolution with a hemispherical nose was determined from wind-tunnel tests at a mach number of 1.97 .  the investigation indicated that the local heat-transfer parameter, based on flow conditions just outside the boundary layer, decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at the stagnation point of the hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the junction with the cylindrical afterbody .  because measurements of the static pressure distribution over the hemisphere indicated that the local flow pattern tended to become stationary as the free-stream mach number was increased to 3.8, this distribution of heat-transfer parameter is believed representative of all mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of temperatures less than that of dissociation .  the local heat-transfer parameter was independent of reynolds number based on body diameter in the range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .   the measured distribution of heat-transfer parameter agreed within theoretical distribution calculated with foreknowledge only of the pressure distribution about the body .  this method, applicable to any body of revolution with an isothermal surface, combines the mangler transformation, stewartson transformation, and thermal solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow problem, and thus evaluates the heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric compressible flow in terms of the known heat-transfer rate in an approximately equivalent two-dimensional incompressible flow .   measurements of recovery-temperature distributions at mach numbers of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery factors having an average value of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which increased abruptly at the shoulder to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on the cylindrical afterbody .  this result suggests that the usual representation of the laminar recovery factor as the square root of the prandtl number is conservative in the presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .

        "text": " hypersonic shock layer theory of the stagnation region at low reynolds number . cheng, h.k. hypersonic flow at low reynolds number is studied utilizing the shock-layer concept . the present formulation takes into account the salient features of the transport processes within the shock layer in a manner consistent with the shock-layer approximation . the rankine-hugoniot shock relations are modified to include contributions due to heat conduction and viscous effects immediately behind the shock . the specific problem of an axisymmetric stagnation region is treated . the flow regimes for this problem can be classified according to whether  or not the transport effects are important immediately behind the shock . in one regime where the ordinary rankine-hugoniot relations hold  across the shock, the vorticity-interaction theory based on the boundary-layer approximation is shown to be sufficient . in the other regime where the rankine-hugoniot relations have to be modified but the continuum-flow model applies, an approximate, an analytical solution is obtained . this solution reveals a substantial reduction of the temperature behind the shock and of the shock stand-off distance in the presence of strong surface cooling . the present study is intended to provide a knowledge to bridge the gap between the free-molecule flow regime and that of the boundary layer via  the continuum theory . in this respect, the solution obtained appears to be satisfactory in that it yields the correct free-molecule limits for the skin friction and surface-heat transfer rate .

        "text": " investigation of full scale split trailing edge wing flaps with various chords and hinge locations .   an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a. full-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing flaps .  the object of the investigation was to determine and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap deflection, and flap location along the wing chord .  the chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0 to 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8 percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge .  the investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution tests, and downwash surveys .  the results give the lift, the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure distribution over the flaps and wing at one section, and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing combinations .   an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the airplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching moment .  the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with increase in flap deflection or flap chord .  flap normal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap deflection and were relatively independent of flap chord, hinge-axis location, and airplane attitude .  the location of the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of the hinge axis remained practically constant irrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or location .  flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a power of flap chord greater than the square so that with regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most efficient in producing a given increase in lift .   split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the magnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing profile .  at low angles of attack the predominant effect of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface pressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively the upper-surface pressures .  downwash surveys indicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing chord line would be more effective than those below the chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of the airplane with flaps deflected .

        "text": " investigation of the laminar aerodynamics heat transfer characteristics of a hemisphere cylinder in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6. 8.   a program to investigate the aerodynamic heat transfer of a nonisothermal hemisphere-cylinder has been conducted in the langley 11-inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 6.8 and a reynolds number from approximately 0.14x10 to experimental heat-transfer coefficients were slightly less over the whole body than those predicted by the theory of stine and wanlass (naca technical note 3344) for an isothermal surface .  for stations within 45 of the stagnation point the heat-transfer coefficients could be correlated by a single relation between local stanton number and local reynolds number .   pitot pressure profiles taken at a mach number of 6.8 on a hemisphere-cylinder have verified that the local mach number or velocity outside the boundary layer required in the theories may be computed from the surface pressures by using isentropic flow relations and conditions immediately behind a normal shock . the experimental pressure distribution at a mach number of velocity gradients calculated at the stagnation point by using the modified newtonian theory vary with mach number and are in good agreement with those obtained from measured pressures for mach numbers from 1.2 to 6.8 .   at the stagnation point the theory of sibulkin, in which the diameter and conditions behind the normal shock were used, was in good agreement with the experiment when the velocity gradient at the stagnation point appropriate to the free-stream mach number was used .

        "text": " some experiments relating to the problem of simulation of hot jet engines in studies of jet effects on adjacent surfaces at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 . an investigation at a free-stream mach number of 1.80 in a blowdown type  tunnel was made to study the effect on the pressure distribution of a zero angle of attack wing surface when certain exhaust parameters of a hot turbojet engine are varied . static-pressure surveys were made on a wing surface that was located in the vicinity of a small-scale propulsive jet . this propulsive jet was operated with four types of jet exhausts . these jet exhausts were a hot jet /hydrogen burned in air/, a  cold air jet, a cold helium jet, and a jet composed of a mixture of two  cold gases /hydrogen and carbon dioxide/ . the hot jet, because of its high exhaust temperature /3,300degreer/ and because combustion was performed in air, was believed reasonably able to simulate the exhaust parameters of an actual afterburning turbojet engine . the cold jets used were selected in order that the effects of a variation in the exhaust parameters of jet-exit static-pressure ratio, ratio of specific heats, density, and velocity, could be obtained by comparing each cold jet with the hot jet or with another cold jet . the tests were made over  a range of jet-exit staticpressure ratios from 1 to 9 with values of the ratio of specific heats of 1.27, 1.40, and 1.66 and at variations in  density and velocity of the order of approximately 8 and 3 times, respectively . within the scope of this investigation, it was found that jet-exit static-pressure ratio and the ratio of specific heats affected the pressure distribution on the wing associated with jet interference while  a variation in exit velocity and density did not . the jet-exit staticpressure ratio affected the wing pressure distribution in a major way while the ratio of specific heats had only a minor effect . the addition of temperature in the propulsive jet exhaust at a jet-exit staticpressure ratio of 4 had little or no effect on the pressure distribution associated with jet interference on the wing .

        "text": " low-speed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect ratio wings having variations in leading-edge contour . an investigation has been conducted at various reynolds numbers and low subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect-ratio wings having variations in leading-edge contours . the planforms included a highly swept triangular wing, a rectangular wing, and intermediate wings including planforms having elliptic and parabolic leading-edge contours, all having an aspect ratio of 1.33 . the effects of changing aspect ratio for a  given leading-edge contour were investigated for two of the wings presented,. also included are the longitudinal characteristics associated with various fuselage sizes . an effort has been made to estimate the lift variation with angle of attack for the wing planforms of the present investigation . improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible by slight alterations in leading-edge design, which should still conform  to possible design requirements at hypersonic speeds . these changes in  planform resulted in increases in lift-curve slope, lift at high angles  of attack, and in the maximum untrimmed lift-drag ratio, provided the fuselage was sufficiently small . the longitudinal stability characteristics of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability characteristics at high lifts than either a triangular wing or rectangular wing of the same aspect ratio . the effects of increasing reynolds number for each of the planforms investigated generally resulted in slight reductions in the lift at high angles of attack . a method is presented for estimating the subsonic-lift variation with angle of attack for the low-aspect-ratio wings of the present investigation and indicated good agreement with experimental data throughout the angle-of-attack range of this investigation .

        "text": " the bending of uniformly loaded clamped plate in the form of a circular sector .   the deflexion of a uniformly loaded plate in the form of a semicircle clamped along its boundary is obtained by a method due to weinstein .  this problem requires the solution of the biharmonic equation where z is given, subject to the conditions that w = 0 and on the boundary, n being the direction of the outward normal .  the solution is expressed in the form where, writing is found by solving (in succession) two harmonic equations of the forms where z may be zero, and where f and have to satisfy certain boundary conditions . the constants are then determined to satisfy the boundary condition .   numerical calculations show that five or six terms of the series give a good approximation to the accurate value as judged by the closeness with which the approximate solution satisfies the boundary condition .  the procedure to be adopted in the case of the general circular sector and for non-uniform loading is indicated briefly .   the connexion between the deflexion problem and that of plane strain in which the stress function satisfies the equation, where and have given values on the boundary, is discussed as a preliminary to the further consideration of the latter problem by a method of the same type .

        "text": " the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression . in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts . by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory . this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started,. this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process . furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process .   in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression .  first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection .  then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine .

        "text": " effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circular-cylindrical shells under bending.   the effect of internal pressure on the small-deflection buckling of thin-walled cylinders under bending is investigated by means of a modified donnell equation .  the results indicate that the maximum critical stress due to bending increases with internal pressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders under compression .  these results represent the moment at which significant deformations appear in the cylinder, rather than the maximum moment able to be carried, but may be a good approximation to the latter for metal cylinders .

        "text": " some low speed problems of high speed aircraft . the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more . no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable geometry . in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of  flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it  is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground effect on maximum lift . more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of  available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control, and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed . finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised . the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants . two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some detail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort .  some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn . a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .

        "text": " an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity of sonic booms .   this paper is a brief summary of an investigation made to check the effect of lift on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic speeds .  the method of hayes has been combined with the theory of whitham to predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings carrying lift and of combinations of bodies and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as general, method was derived by walkden in ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the volume term, has been used extensively to predict the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies and the agreement with experiment has, so far, been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft. altitude and the calculations of this paper show that under those conditions the shock noise of the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases, be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown that at higher altitudes lifting effects will dominate for even the small fighter and they will dominate over most of the altitude range for large bomber and supersonic transport aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases with altitude as which compares to in the volume case (=pressure at altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number, wing loading, wing plan shape and lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating the shock noise due to combined volume and lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to configurations with wings located towards the rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift) or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is presented from which rapid estimates can be made of the shock noise of lifting wing-body combinations .

        "text": " small bending and stretching of sandwich type shells .   a theory has been developed for small bending and stretching of sandwich-type shells .  this theory is an extension of the known theory of homogeneous thin elastic shells .  it was found that two effects are important in the present problem, which have not been considered previously in the theory of curved shells ..  (1) the effect of transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no counterpart in flat-plate theory .   the general results of this report have been applied to the solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects of transverse shear and normal stress deformation .   the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse core flexibility .   the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant .   solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .

        "text": " a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells .   a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien .   in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs . these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome .   experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated .

        "text": " the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model . the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected  by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less  than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter . lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model . gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation  of the model .

        "text": " a method of calculating the short period longitudinal stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady compressible flow .   a method is developed for the calculation of the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces and moments on a wing performing harmonic pitching and heaving oscillations . the calculation is based on the assumption of inviscid potential flow without shock waves and is restricted to small incidence, so that the linearized theory is valid .   in contrast to other work in the field the theory applies to all mach numbers .  it is restricted to small values of the reduced frequency and should be valid for the usual range of short periods occurring at present in flight .  the formal solution yields two integral equations for the parts of the load, which are in phase and go out of phase with the oscillation,. these are of the same form as the corresponding equation in steady flow .   the way is thus opened for solutions over the whole mach number range at small frequencies, if the corresponding steady solutions can be found .  the calculation is in fact easiest for m = 1 and has been done here for delta-wings to supplement a previous supersonic calculation, made on different frequency assumptions, which broke down near m = 1 . it appears from the two sets of results that the short period oscillation will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex angle of the delta wing is greater than about 60 .  this confirms a now generally recognised trend .   such results near m = 1 must of course be invalidated to an unknown extent by thickness viscosity and shock waves at their maximum effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that these factors will remove the critical nature of the transonic damping as calculated by this method . with all its obvious limitations this method, when extended to other planforms, should provide a useful tool in studying the effect of geometrical parameters on the stability of an aircraft at transonic speeds .

        "text": " investigation of normal force distributions and wake vortex characteristics of bodies of revolution at supersonic speeds .   the supersonic aerodynamic characteristics of inclined bodies of revolution at high angles of attack have been investigated in order to provide a more basic understanding of the body vortex wake flow and its relation to the problem of body-wing interference .  the results of wind-tunnel tests, whereby the normal force, pitching moment, normal force distributions, and the local flow properties in the vicinity of the body were determined, are discussed and analyzed .   comparisons of experimental normal force coefficient and center of pressure data with values calculated in accordance with theories which include methods for estimating the effects of viscosity show that the accuracy of these estimates is strongly dependent on the body fineness ratio and the angle of attack . further comparisons of the distributions of theoretical and experimentally derived cross-flow drag coefficients clearly show that, in general, the disagreement between experiment and existing theories is due to the inadequate prediction of the magnitude and distribution of the forces resulting from flow separation .   the circulation strengths of the concentrated vortices and the circulation strengths of the vortex feeding sheets in the body vortex wake are determined by closed-contour velocity-perimeter integrations for paths enclosing the vortex or the feeding sheet . the values of vortex strength calculated in this manner are in close agreement with the values predicted by vortex strength formulas written for a simple theoretical model for which it is assumed that the cross-flow in any plane along the cylindrical portion of the body is represented by the steady incompressible potential flow about a cylinder, two symmetrical vortices of equal strength, and the attendant image vortices .  however, in computing these strengths it is necessary to use the vortex locations and the viscous normal force distributions determined from experiment .   the experimentally determined values of vortex strength are, in turn, used to calculate--by means of the aforementioned incompressible cross-flow potential--the local flow inclination angles which are in good agreement with the measured values, except in the vortex core, in the vicinity of the feeding sheet, and in regions for which transonic cross-flow velocities are expected .  a consideration of these various regions with simple methods which account for the observed phenomena leads to substantial improvement in the agreement between theory and experiment .   it is indicated that the complete vortex wake flow may be adequately predicted for a body of revolution (for conditions represented by the theoretical flow model), provided that the distribution of the viscous normal force and the vortex locations are accurately known .

        "text": " a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending .   the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections .   in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data .   it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well .   the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .

        "text": " exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream .   the effect of a forward-facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach 6 free stream was investigated experimentally .  the models tested had forward-facing jets using air and helium exhausting at mach numbers from 1 to 10.3 and were run through a range of the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure of 0.03 (jet off) to 2.5 .  the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter varied from 1.12 to 55.6 and the angle of attack was varied from 0 to 35 .   the experimental results show that the main-stream shock can be affected by the jet in two significantly different ways . one way is simply to move the strong shock away from the body without altering its shape .  the second and perhaps more interesting case occurs when the jet causes a large displacement of the main shock and considerably changes its shape .  it was found that the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary to obtain the large displacements of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter and also on the jet-exit mach number .  the maximum amount the shock could be displaced in percent of body diameter was seen to increase with increasing jet-exit mach number and also with decreasing ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter .  for the models that were investigated through an angle-of-attack range, the displacement became very unsteady and fell off sharply as the angle of attack was increased .   simplified theoretical considerations applied to the shock-displacement phenomena provide a possible explanation for the two different types of main-stream shock displacement .  theoretical curves show the regions where these types of displacement would occur for different exit mach numbers and pressure ratios for a forward-facing jet in a mach 6 stream .

        "text": " on fully developed channel flows,. some solutions and limitations, and effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces . an examination of the effects of compressibility, variable properties, and body forces on fully developed laminar flows has indicated several limitations on such streams . in the absence of a pressure gradient, but presence of a body force liquid this follows also for the case of a constant streamwise pressure gradient . these motions are exact in the sense of a couette flow . in the liquid case two solutions /not a new result/ can occur for the same boundary conditions . an approximate analytic solution was found which agrees closely with machine calculations . in the case of approximately exact flows, it turns out that for large temperature variations across the channel the effects of convection /due  to, say, a wall temperature gradient/ and frictional heating must be negligible . in such a case the energy and momentum equations are separated, and the solutions are readily obtained . if the temperature variations are small, then both convection effects and frictional heating can consistently be considered . this case becomes the constant-property incompressible case /or quasi-incompressible case for free-convection flows/ considered by many authors . finally, there is a brief discussion of cases wherein streamwise variations of all quantities are allowed but only in such form that the independent variables are separable . for the case where the streamwise velocity varies inversely as the square root of distance along the channel, a solution is given .

        "text": " concerning some solutions of the boundary layer equations in hydrodynamics .   the boundary-layer equations for a steady two-dimensional motion are solved for any given initial velocity distribution (distribution along a normal to the boundary wall, downstream of which the motion is to be calculated) .  this initial velocity distribution is assumed expressible as a polynomial in the distance from the wall .  three cases are considered .. first, when in the initial distribution the velocity vanishes at the wall, but its gradient along the normal does not,. second, when the velocity in the initial distribution does not vanish at the wall,. and third, when both the velocity and its normal gradient vanish at the wall (as at a point where the forward flow separates from the boundary) .  the solution is found as a power series in some fractional power of the distance along the wall, whose coefficients are functions of the distance from the wall to be found from ordinary differential equations .  some progress is made in the numerical calculation of these coefficients, especially in the first case .  the main object was to find means for a step-by-step calculation of the velocity field in a boundary layer, and it is thought that such a procedure may possibly be successful even if laborious .  the same mathematical method is used to calculate the flow behind a flat plate along a stream .  the results are shown in curves in the original .

        "text": " design and test of mixed-flow impellers, viii - comparison of experimental results for three impellers with shroud redesigned by rapid approximate method . three centrifugal impellers with parabolic, circular, and skewed-parabolic blading were modified by a recently developed design procedure  to reduce the velocity gradients along the hub from inlet to outlet . all original dimensions except the shroud contours were retained . experimental investigation showed that the modified impellers had better performance characteristics than the original impellers at all speeds investigated, the greatest gains occurring at speeds of 1300 feet per second and higher . these large gains probably resulted primarily from more favorable velocity gradients and from designing these impellers further away from the condition necessary for eddy formation . the modified impellers were thus able to operate over a wider range of weight flows at high speeds . the modified impellers were investigated over a range of equivalent speeds of 900 to 1500 feet per second and flow rates from maximum to the  point of incipient surge . at 1300 feet per second, the peak pressure ratio and maximum adiabatic temperature-rise efficiency for the parabolic-bladed impeller were 3.07 and 0.825, respectively . for the same conditions, the circular-bladed impeller and the skewed-parabolic-bladed  impeller had pressure ratios of 3.13 and 3.15 and efficiencies of 0.737  and 0.805, respectively . of the three, the parabolic-bladed impeller had the highest maximum efficiencies /0.854 to 0.800/ and the best weight-flow range over the speed range tested . on the basis of the parameters investigated, it appears that parabolic blading is superior to circular blading . the experimental results indicate that the design method of naca tn 3399 is a reliable method for use in designing centrifugal impellers .

        "text": " extension of boundary layer separation criteria to a m=6 .5 utilizing flat plates with forward-facing steps .   an experimental investigation has been made of the separation phenomena on a flat plate to which forward-facing steps were attached to force separation .  both laminar and turbulent flows were investigated over a mach number range of approximately distributions, shadowgraph and chemical film techniques, the pressure rise at separation, the laminar plateau pressure, and the turbulent peak pressure were determined . boundary-layer surveys were made on a smooth flat plate and on a flat plate with roughness to force transition .  examinations of the separated flow showed that the predominant variable in the determination of the pressure distribution was the location of transition relative to the separation point and reattachment . pure laminar, transitional, and turbulent types of separation were found in this mach number range .  the peak static-pressure-rise ratios for identical forward-facing steps at a mach number of 6.25 were approximately 1.5 and 5.0, respectively, for pure laminar and turbulent separation .  the effect of reynolds number on the peak pressure rise for turbulent separation for the lower mach number range was found to be very minor provided the step height was of the order of the boundary-layer thickness .  as the mach number is increased, the peak pressure coefficient for turbulent separation decreased from approximately 0.18 at a mach number of 4 to about 0.13 at a mach number of 6.25 .  the pressure coefficient at the separation point for laminar separation decreases from approximately 0.014 at a mach number of value at a mach number of 6.5 .  the results obtained with forward-facing steps agree with the trends predicted, based upon lower mach number studies .

        "text": " static aerodynamic characteristics of short blunt cones with various nose and base cone angles at mach numbers of 0. 6 to 5. 5 and angles of attack to 180 .   wind-tunnel tests have been performed at mach numbers from 0.6 to 5.5 to determine coefficients of normal force, axial force, and pitching moment for short blunt cones, as affected by changes in nose and base cone angles .  models with nose half-angles of 10 and 20 were investigated . the 10 nose half-angle models were tested with a flat base and with base cones of 50 and 70 half-angle .  the 20 nose half-angle model had a 50 half-angle base cone .  reynolds numbers for the test ranged from about maximum diameter .   variations in the base cone angle resulted in significant changes in the aerodynamic characteristics, with lesser effects resulting from changes in nose cone angle .  in particular, the model with the 50 half-angle conical base had only one trim angle flat base and 70 half-angle conical base had two trim angles (a = 0 and a = 180) .  estimated variations of the aerodynamic characteristics with angle of attack by means of a modified newtonian theory were in good agreement with the experimental results . the theory, however, failed to predict the trim point at a = 180 for the flat-based model .

        "text": " note on creep buckling of columns .   the phenomenological theory previously proposed in naca technical note 4000 for the behavior of metals at elevated temperatures has been modified to yield transient creep curves by assuming that the metal consists of two phases, each with its own elasticity and viscosity .  the extended theory satisfies the basic requirements for a theory of transient creep at elevated temperatures .. that the transient creep be closely connected with the subsequent steady creep, and that the apparent exponent of the time in the transient region be permitted wide variations between 0 and 1 .  from this theory it is possible to construct nondimensional creep curves which extend continuously from the transient region into the steady-state region .  the corresponding family of creep curves for any metal may be obtained from the nondimensional family by use of appropriate constants .  the constants required are those obtained from steady creep measurements, together with two additional constants which represent the difference between the phases .  the transient creep curves resulting from this theory are compared with the experimental curves for pure aluminum, gamma iron, lead, and agreement is found .

        "text": " on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .   experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully separated wakes are presented .  the afterbodies are generally similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end of the forebody .   tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering models on the order of 5 ft. in diameter at about 120,000 ft. altitude .  stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r. to   strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a short distance and then connects with the afterbody .  judiciously interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat wider applicability for approximation purposes .  the results are presented and compared with each other in terms of nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the forebody .   the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be roughly uniform in each run .  for a given point on an afterbody, the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or reynolds number .  the present pressures and pressure-reynolds number variations (fig. 8) are compared with values obtained from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data,. qualitative and some quantitative agreement is noted .  in the reynolds number range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit boundary layers were considered to be laminar .  an approximate check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present tests also indicates a laminar rate .  no information was obtained concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated boundary layer covering the wake .  an adverse pressure gradient on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs. 7(a) and 7(c) was observed .   heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise direction is noted .  the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end) roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig. 13) .   heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost twice the values on the sides .  the heat rates on the large-step body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height .   in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach number square increases linearly with reynolds number .  the effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody heat rates increase sharply .  the expansion angle on the afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the stepped down bodies,. this may affect the decreased heat rates on this body .

        "text": " the nonlinear conical spring .   the large symmetric deformations of shallow conical shells are of interest in the design of nonlinear conical disk springs .  in most applications a uniformly distributed axial load acts at the inner and outer edges,. these edges are otherwise free .  several approximations have been proposed to describe the behavior of these springs .  a first approximation (1) is based on the assumption that meridional strains are negligible .  this requires that the shell remain conical after deformation and also that the extensional strain of meridional lines on the middle surface vanish . another approximation (2) retains only the assumption that the shell remains conical .  the first assumption satisfies neither of the two boundary conditions at the free edges,. the latter violates the condition of vanishing moment at the free edges . recently the authors presented a series solution (3) for a special case, namely, the case of an annular plate under similar loading . numerical solutions for the shallow conical shell under these conditions of load have also been obtained (4) .  an examination of these results indicates that the meridional bending stresses are of much smaller magnitude than the circumferential bending stresses .  hence the present analysis is based on the neglect of the meridional bending moment .

(wind-on frequency determination was accurate only to approximately 1 percent .) ",

        "text": " ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone .   the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties .  there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development .  since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream .  however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .

        "text": " plastic stability theory of thin shells .   considerable interest is currently centered on the role of deformation and flow types of plasticity theories in the solution of stability problems .  for thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with classical stability theory appears to yield results which are in substantially good agreement with test data . on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear to require the introduction of initial imperfections in order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with tests .   thus, in view of the current state of development of plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of thin shells .  although there may be theoretical objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results obtained from this theory .   in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant unequal radii is derived .  this set of three equations applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any loading system leading to buckling .  for particular problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres under external pressure, the set of equations can be reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial displacement only .  these donnell-type equations are used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres under external pressure and long and moderate length cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads .  the limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under compression or shear, represent the solutions for short cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively .

(a) even with initial imperfections the incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory, which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are significant .   it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other experimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6 aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential modes .  in particular, this writer does not believe that lee has proved that initial imperfections are important for the group of cylinders that he has tested .  on the contrary, it is believed that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this group of cylinders although of probable significance in other cases .

        "text": " torispherical shells - a caution to designers .   it has recently become apparent, through a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case that designing torispherical shells by the current edition of the asme code on unfired pressure vessels can lead to failure during proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose of the present paper is to show in what respects the code fails to give accurate results . as an illustrative example, a hypothetical pressure vessel with a torispherical head having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was selected .  the supports of the vessel were considered to be either on the main cylinder or around the torus .  the vessel was subjected to internal pressure and the elastic stresses in it were determined rigorously and by the code .  a comparison of the two revealed that the code predicted stresses in the head which were less than one half of those actually occurring .  furthermore, the code gave no indication of the presence of high compressive circumferential direct stresses which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically the entire torus .  if the head had been fabricated using a steel with a yield point of would have failed or undergone large deformations, whereas the code would have predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules for torispherical heads are thus in need of revision for certain geometries .  the implications of the foregoing results are currently being studied by the asme,. in the interim, however, designers should exercise care in applying the code to torispherical shells .   it is also shown in the paper that the use of the membrane state as a particular solution of the differential equations is not a good approximation for toroidal shells of the type considered .

        "text": " on the influence of wall boundary layers in closed transonic test sections . the boundary layers at the test section walls of a transonic wind tunnel  are known to reduce the wall interference . in the present paper this effect is studied by means of small perturbation theory, assuming viscosity to be negligible when perturbing a turbulent boundary layer . an approximation for thin boundary layers leads to a modified boundary condition at the wall of the test section, expressing the normal streamline slope induced by changes in mass flow density and crossflow within the boundary layer . this boundary condition is applied to the linearized equations of subsonic flow and to the non-linear transonic equations at choking, the cases of plane and circular test sections only  being treated in detail . the results of linear theory show that all corrections except the three-dimensional angle-of-attack correction are considerably reduced by  the presence of the boundary layers at mach numbers greater than 0.9, the essential part of their influence being due to the change of mass flow density with pressure . in the case of choking the analysis indicates that the presence of boundary layers will increase the maximum model size for which the flow can be interpreted as corresponding to mach number one in free flight . finally, the technique of using artificial thickening of the wall boundary layers for a reduction of wall interference is considered, though without reaching a definite conclusion as to its value as compared to other techniques .

(a) axial compression, and (b) uniform radial-band loading, where the width of the band is small compared to the length of the shell .   for each type of loading it is shown that the strengthening effect of the elastic core becomes more significant with the increasing values of the radius-thickness ratio . for example, it is shown that for the geometric and elastic constants considered it is possible, with the presence of the core, to increase the axial buckling stress by as much as 65 percent over the values found for those without an elastic core .  the elastic core is even more effective in stabilizing the shell against buckling due to band loading, the peak pressure required to buckle the filled specimen being 7.30 times that required to buckle the unfilled shell .

        "text": " the blunt-leading-edge problem in hypersonic flow .   the present paper is mainly concerned with the hypersonic flow over a flat plate with a blunt nose .  the analysis is based on the flow model in which the flow field behind the shock wave may be divided into two regions ..  the inviscid-hypersonic-flow region and the entropy layer, across which the pressure has no appreciable change .  the equations for the entropy layer can be reduced to those of the usual boundary-layer problem with the exception that the outer edge of the entropy layer, as well as the pressure remain unknown .  these unknowns are determined so as to approximately match the entropy-layer solution with the inviscid hypersonic solution in which the shock wave has the shape of the power law of the distance from the leading edge .  the assumed flow model is shown to be valid over a restricted range depending on the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio and (where is the reynolds number based on half the thickness of nose t, m the freestream mach number, and c the chapman-rubesin constant . actual calculations have been carried out for the case with typical values of and the wall-to-stagnation temperature ratio . the calculated values for both the surface pressure and heat-transfer rate are compared with the experimental data .  as regards surface pressure in particular, a satisfactory agreement with the data is obtained .  the validity of the assumptions upon which the present analysis is based has been examined from the numerical results, and the region of the validity has been found to extend over a certain large range of the nondimensional distance from the leading edge .

        "text": " a study of slender shapes of minimum drag using the newton-busemann pressure coefficient law .   the problem of minimizing the drag of a slender, two- dimensional or axisymmetric body in hypersonic flow at zero angle of attack is considered under the assumption that the pressure coefficient law is newton's impact law as modified by busemann in order to include centripetal acceleration effects .  after the condition that the pressure coefficient be nonnegative is accounted for and after arbitrary conditions are imposed on, in addition to the thickness and the length, the enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour in the two-dimensional case and the wetted area and the volume in the axisymmetric case, the minimal problem is formulated as a problem of the mayer type and solved by the combined use of the euler-lagrange equations, the transversality condition, the erdmann-weierstrass corner condition, and the properties of the switching function .   particular attention is devoted to the class of problems such that, among the four quantities being considered, two are prescribed while the remaining are free .  for these problems, the extremal arc is composed of two subarcs ..  one is characterized by a positive pressure coefficient and is called the regular shape,. the other is characterized by a zero pressure coefficient and is called the free layer .  in this connection, the analysis shows the existence of two different types of solutions depending on whether the thickness is given or free .   if the thickness is given, the expression for the regular shape is a power law, and the transition from the regular shape to the free layer occurs in the second half of the body .  in the two- dimensional case, the exponent of the power law is 1 if the length is given if the enclosed area is given, and 3 if the moment of inertia of the contour is given,. the transition point from the power body to the free layer is located at 50 percent of the length if the length is given, at 66 percent if the enclosed area is given, and at the axisymmetric case, the exponent of the power law is if the length is given, 1 if the wetted area is given, and if the volume is given,. the transition point from the power body to the free layer is located at 60 percent of the length if the length is given, at 70 percent if the wetted area is given, and at 80 percent if the volume is given .   on the other hand, for problems where the thickness is free, the equation governing the regular shape is not that of a power body, and the point of transition to the free layer is located in the first half of the body .  in the two-dimensional case, the transition point is at 28 percent of the length if the length and the enclosed area are given, at 32 percent if the length and the moment of inertia of the contour are given, and at 45 percent if the enclosed area and the moment of inertia of the contour are given . in the axisymmetric case, the transition point is located at 35 percent of the length if the length and the wetted area are given, at 39 percent if the length and the volume are given, and at 46 percent if the wetted area and the volume are given .   for all of the cases considered, analytical expressions are obtained for the optimum shapes, the thickness ratios, and the drag coefficients .

        "text": " aerodynamic processes in the downwash-impingement problem .   theoretical and experimental data relating to the downwash impingement problem are examined in order to arrive at a coherent understanding of the process of entrainment of ground particles in the flow .  it is demonstrated that a key mechanism in the process is the interaction of nonuniform flow in the ground boundary layer with bluff ground particles .  this interaction produces a lift force which, under typical conditions, equals or exceeds the particle weight .   in the interest of quantitative prediction of the conditions necessary for particle entrainment, four subsidiary problem areas in the impinging jet are examined .  these are the viscous decay, the inviscid flow field, the ground boundary layer, and the forces on a bluff body in nonuniform flow .  applicable theories are used in conjunction with experimental data to assess the accuracy and range of validity of the theories, and to define the stream conditions which will cause particle entrainment .   available data are applied to the establishment of criteria for particle entrainment in the vicinity of the impinging-jet stagnation point .  these criteria show that entrainment occurs in a finite annular region on the ground plane, and that the particles most readily entrained are those with a diameter equal to about two-thirds the thickness of the ground boundary layer .  the configuration size is shown to influence the process in that the onset of entrainment is fixed by the jet diameter and velocity, and the size of the ground particles .  the criteria established provide a quantitative estimate of the conditions causing entrainment and provide a basis for scaling experimental results to a variety of full-scale situations .

(b) for the integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component that determines the critical point .   the approach is justified by a study of the equations governing the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow problems for which closed form solutions are available .  the range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by practical application and comparison with experiment,. results are presented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air stream at m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensional configuration at m = 8 .

        "text": " a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer over a curved surface .   the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream .   the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the generalized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer equations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the boundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple transformation, the governing differential equation can be expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation for zero surface curvature .   numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient have been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex surfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase again .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a different method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic differences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular, murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall it is higher .

        "text": " body under lifting wing .   an investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations composed of a cambered body positioned a certain distance beneath an arbitrary lifting wing .  the geometry of the wing is regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or optimum .  expressions for the drag and lift are obtained from reverse-flow considerations,. these greatly implement such a study when interference cross flows must be cancelled .  the drag advantage to be gained when a given body and wing assume a given orientation is studied .  treated more extensively is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed lift . numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large number of parameters appearing in the problem .  of these, the gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly important .  it is found that at low gap moderate body distortions have a significant influence on the drag .  drag reductions of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been found at a mach number of 2.24 in a configuration having a gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body, and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body . comparison is made with the conventional wing-body combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not appreciably diminished .  finally, it is shown that the configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations .   tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile wing .  the mach number was 1.6 and the reynolds number was 9.17 x 10 based on the body length .  it was found that the measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the body agrees very well with the theoretical value .  downstream of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior .  the separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the body of the shock-induced cross flow .  further observations suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the shock-induced cross flow .

        "text": " some considerations on the laminar stability of time-dependent basic flows . as a stability criterion for infinitesimal disturbances in an incompressible, parallel but time-dependent basic flow, it is proposed to introduce the concept of /momentary stability,/ which is said to prevail at the instant if the kinetic energy of the disturbances, as a fraction of the kinetic energy of the basic flow, tends to decrease .  the significance of such a criterion is briefly discussed . for special time-dependent basic flows which are described by similar velocity profiles at all times (except for changes in amplitude), in the inviscid limit only a change of the time scale is needed to reduce the solution essentially to that for the steady case .  the disturbances may be of either the transverse-wave or the longitudinal-vortices type .  the result indicates a very strong destabilizing influence of deceleration, which is likely to overshadow that of the velocity profile under normal circumstances .  the observations of fales rotating cylinders) are believed to be largely due to the deceleration . at finite reynolds numbers, the usual procedure of calculating the stability solution on the basis of the instantaneous profile is further shown to be valid only for extremely slow acceleration or deceleration . even when the solution is acceptable, the condition for neutral stability may not be used without reservation .  to calculate momentary stability properly, a procedure for a slowly varying but more general profile is also described .

        "text": " on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet .   a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the / quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound- emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it .   the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer . acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/ or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium . however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to lighthill .   those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer are significantly modified by the viscous action through the critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it . kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as, predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of the shear-layer profiles .

        "text": " solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problems by means of high-speed digital computers .   the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximate solution of the integral equation which represents the potential flow about a finite wing, with no restrictions beyond those necessary for linearization .  after assuming the usual series representation of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solution is achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of the transformed integral equation by single and double fourier series and performing termwise integrations analytically .  this is followed by the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at selected control points .  in this procedure the number of control point used is limited only by the storage capacity of the computer .  control points may be located so as to cover the entire wing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements, permitting the accurate representation of complicated mean surface shapes .   an evaluation of the proposed method is included . comparisons with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tank results are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed method when applied to plane wings .  a final evaluation involves a comparison of calculated surface pressure distribution with wind-tunnel measurements on a swept, tapered wing with a cambered and twisted mean surface .  the agreement evidenced in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy as similar comparisons on plane wing planforms .  in either case, the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracy requirements for most aircraft design studies .

        "text": " an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method .   the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs .   employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .

        "text": " theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamics .   a supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite cylinder as a hub is studied .  the forward speed may be subsonic, but the relative speed at each section is supersonic .  the lightly loaded blades are represented by a surface distribution of appropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary supersonic thin-wing theory .  these sources are found by approximating the exact potential for a constant-strength compressible source traveling along a helical path .  the usual relationship between the source strength and boundary condition is found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry .   tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard and krasilshchikova .  the present investigation, however, is restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears off the tip .  for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the upwash region off the tip .  by transforming to a curvilinear, nonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral equation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is derived .  without having to solve this equation, it is shown that the potential for a point in the tip region can be obtained in terms of an integration of known source distributions over the blade surface only .   the case of a twisted flat plate of particular planform is treated, and a sample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion of the blade, as well as over the entire tip region .   though this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles .

        "text": " some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition and heat transfer at supersonic speeds .   large downstream movements of transition observed when the leading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the detached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction is computed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 . concurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar boundary layer .   the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is substantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is blunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or leading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading edge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with the hollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 .   application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields the result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leading edge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements of transition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 3.0 to 30 at mach the possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and friction drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds .   mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20 .  the dissipation and stability of these profiles are discussed, and a method is described for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce the maximum possible downstream movement of transition .

        "text": " survey of inviscid hypersonic flow theory for geometrically slender shapes .   a survey is made of existing theories for the calculation of pressure distributions on slender bodies at hypersonic speeds .  no account is taken of boundary layer displacement effects which are expected to become important above a mach number of about 10 for a slender body .   first the breakdown of linearised supersonic theory is demonstrated as mach number increases above about 5, and this is followed by a derivation of the hypersonic similarity rule .  this section includes a description of the piston-analogy .   next a physical interpretation of hypersonic flow is outlined and a simple derivation of the modified newtonian pressure formula is given .   the equations of flow through an oblique shock wave are simplified by assuming a strong shock, and various results are thereby derived .  these include the tangent-wedge and tangent-cone formulae .   this is followed by a description of the newtonian approximation for slender bodies, including the effect of centrifugal forces, and the connection with newtonian flow theory is emphasized for .   the shock-expansion method is described in some detail for both two-and three-dimensional bodies, and finally some remarks are made about the available data sheets and tables for estimating pressures on cones and ogive-cylinders in yaw .   the note does not claim to be original, even in presentation .  the aim has been to prepare a reasonably complete survey of available theory for hypersonic flow over slender bodies, excluding viscous and explicit real gas effects .   this will provide the background for further work in which experimental data will be analysed and in conjunction with which it is hoped to produce accurate design methods for estimating pressures and forces on shapes intended for sustained flight at hypersonic speeds .

        "text": " qualitiative solutions of the stability equation for a boundary layer in  contact with various forms of flexible surface . an appropriate form of the boundary layer stability equation is developed for the condition where the fluid is in contact with an isotropic and homogeneous elastic medium, and various approximate analytical solutions obtained for certain types of surface, so as to reveal at least qualitatively the origin and characteristics of neutral oscillations . in the worked solutions the elastic medium is treated as nondissipative, and the interior boundary is supposed either fixed, or free  of stress, or exposed to fluid .. the boundary layer, also, is treated as that over a flat-plate in an incompressible fluid . the results obtained show that the presence of such a resiliant surface introduces the possibility of a number of other modes of oscillation schlichting waves . most of these modes have speeds of propagation determined largely by the properties of the elastic material, and their presence may well be effectively a matter of 'non-viscous' flow stability -dash a subject not treated here . the tollmien-schlichting mode has its minimum reynolds number increased by the presence of the surface, but if the interior boundary is free there may be an upper limit as well . indeed, a sufficiently thin free surface, or one of low rigidity, apparently eliminates neutral oscillations of this mode altogether, only at the expense, however, of the introduction of a mode of flexural waves .

(3) using the equivalence the flow field produced by heat addition and by magnetohydrodynamical body forces can be computed .   examples for a two-dimensional flat plate, a delta wing, an axially symmetric slender body, and a wedge-shaped afterbody are computed at subsonic and supersonic speeds . the efficiency of lift or thrust production by surface heat addition is very low at subsonic speeds .  at supersonic speeds the efficiency is compared with the efficiency of a conventional turbojet-powered aircraft configuration .  it is found that the efficiency of lift or thrust production by heat addition on two-dimensional bodies is approximately the same as that for a turbojet-powered two-dimensional body .  the efficiency is somewhat higher at low supersonic mach numbers and behaves as, decreasing to a constant value as increases . on the other hand, the efficiency of thrust production by heat addition increases linearly with mach number when heat is added on the rear surface of an axially symmetric afterbody of parabolic shape .

        "text": " secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock layers .   when a ramp or other compression surface is located in a locally supersonic region behind a hypersonic bow shock wave, it generates a secondary shock wave .  the ramp flow disturbance may be viewed as an embedded newtonian impact flow if the embedded shock layer is thin . examination of the applicability of newtonian flow theory to cones and wedges in uniform streams suggests that this theory can be expected to give a useful approximation to the surface pressures .   a pressure equation based on this concept predicts a number of interesting things ..  first, pressures can differ from simple newtonian theory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. for example, on flare stabilizers on blunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressures are lower than newtonian and diminish with increasing flight speed in the hypersonic speed range .  the calculated pressures vary over the flare surface as a result of the nonuniformity of its incident stream, and depend on the axial location of the flare .  in the case of a flap mounted on a large-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressure coefficients vary from 1 to 5 through the variable entropy layer .  a pressure coefficient of 5 greater than the maximum possible in newtonian flow can occur because the compression process is more efficient than a single shock wave process .  on areas of the flap that protrude through the main bow wave, the pressure coefficient should revert to the simple newtonian value .   equations are developed for the initial slopes of the normal-force and pitching-moment curves of a flare stabilizer .  in the simplest case these differ from conventional newtonian theory by the ratio of local dynamic pressure to free-stream dynamic pressure .  this ratio takes values as low as 0.1 in some of the examples considered .

        "text": " an approximate solution for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar compressible fluid . an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation, is presented .  the method is employed to determine the velocity field associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation of pai . in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the convective operator in the original partial differential equation is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be treated by well-known techniques . it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous term, rather than the linearization of the convective term . pai's problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique, is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .

        "text": " on the theory of laminar boundary layer involving separation .   the paper presents a mathematical discussion of the laminar boundary layer, which was developed with a view of facilitating the investigation of those boundary layers in particular for which the phenomenon of separation occurs .  the treatment starts with a slight modification of the form of the boundary layer equation first published by von mises .  two approximate solutions of this equation are found, one of which is exact at the outer edge of the boundary layer while the other is exact at the wall .  the final solution is obtained by joining these two solutions at the inflection points of the velocity profiles .  the final solution is given in terms of a series of universal functions for a fairly broad class of potential velocity distributions outside of the boundary layer .  detailed calculations of the boundary layer characteristics are worked out for the case in which the potential velocity is a linear function of the distance from the upstream stagnation point .  finally the complete separation point characteristics are determined for the boundary layer associated with a potential velocity distribution made up of two linear functions of the distance from the stagnation point .  it appears that extensions of the detailed calculations to more complex potential flows can be fairly easily carried out by using the explicit formulae given in the paper .

        "text": " shock wave and flow field development in hypersonic re-entry . a study is made of when and how a shock wave and continuum-type flow field develop in the nose region of a highly cooled blunt body re- entering the atmosphere at hypersonic speed and in a free molecular flow regime . the various types of flow regimes encountered down to low altitude conditions are delineated, and the nature of the flow field and behavior of some of the aerodynamic characteristics are discussed . it is shown that for a highly cooled body, free molecule flow conditions occur at a higher altitude than previously indicated . based on available evidence, it is suggested that kinetic theory solutions, which are essentially modified free molecule results, along with the navier-stokes  equations with no surface slip, serve to define all of the flow regimes  except for a narrow transitional layer regime which has a height of less than one factor of 10 in free stream density change . it is also suggested that the appearance of a definable shock wave occurs very rapidly in terms of density change near the beginning of the transitional layer regime, and that its location, as in continuum flow, is governed principally by the body geometry, whereas its thickness is determined by a local mean free path .

        "text": " the solution of small displacement, stability or vibration problems concerning a flat rectangular panel when the edges are either clamped or simply supported .   this report describes an energy method for the exact solution of problems concerning the small displacements, stability or vibration of a flat rectangular panel when the edges are either clamped or simply supported . the influence of stiffeners which are parallel to one pair of edges, and situated in pairs on opposite sides of the panel so that the neutral axis of each stiffener pair lies in the middle surface of the panel, is taken into account .  the method is not only applicable to isotropic panels but also to aeolotropic panels when the material of the panel has two directions of elastic symmetry parallel to the edges .   the final solution of the problems depends on an infinite set of linear equations for small displacement problems or on an infinite determinantal equation for stability and vibration problems .  the important feature of the analysis given is that it enables a direct approach to be made to these equations in any particular problem .  it is not in general possible to obtain a direct solution of the final equations and it is necessary to approximate and consider a finite set of linear equations or a finite determinantal equation derived from the more important terms in the analytical expression for the transverse displacement of the panel .  here, physical intuition and, if available, experimental data serve as a guide and the accuracy of the final results so obtained is gauged by the rate of convergence with the increase in the number of terms considered .   the general method of solution is applied first to the free vibration of a square panel when all the edges are clamped, and second to the buckling of a square panel under shear when three edges are clamped and one edge is simply supported .
