The first edition of the DDC was published in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's long and healthy life, however, its full story has never been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey that briefly describe his system, but this is the first attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that more than any other has spurred the growth of librarianship in this country and abroad.

        "text": " This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom. Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of information use.  Information transfer in libraries is restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.  There are users of technical information - particularly in technology rather than science - who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal contact with their colleagues and with people in other organizations.  Even regular library users also receive information in other ways. ",

Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which, in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into all aspects of academic library provision. ",

Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

        "text": "      Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a  how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts.      The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.      Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed.     Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors. ",

His love of literature, his respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in his admonition that, though we were primarily a research library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be responsible for these as well as for \"general\" books which crossed disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection, \"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with books through a reading of critical reviews and the books themselves.\"  This counsel is from The President, the Professor, and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was continually impressed upon us.

Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:      Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and evidently resistant to established methods of use and user research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was confirmed.      Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual, social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect his democratic self-realization.      Definitions of \"browsing\" varied greatly: self-indulgence by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his research.

About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.           This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following:           Service should be made available to all users           without any restriction other than access           through a library.           Initially, the service should be confined primarily           to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of           journal articles.           The collection of a center should be comprehensive           in subject coverage excluding only medicine.           All worthwhile journals should be collected           irrespective of language. ",

They are examined thoroughly in books and papers that are cited in the references and the bibliographic note.   Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice. For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is referred to the references cited.  For automation these references are only a modest selection from an enormous literature. ",

At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972, LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the 'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19 September 1973. "

The college library exists, not merely to house and circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching process with reference service, to afford faculty members library opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a service activity, a tool through which library functions are more fully and efficiently realized.   The present work retains most of the material of the first edition, but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in some cases extended. ",

Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case. ",

        "text": "   There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.    Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions.    For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.    The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.    Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.    Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.    The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world.

Additionally, it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn (1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation, and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies, government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the last fourteen years.

Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book, \"Language as Choice and Chance\", the foundation was laid for a truly sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical universe and sample.

But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the 1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to have considerable influence on the course of library development in America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era, and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding of the American Library Association.

He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate.   In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject. ",

It is simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is  to generate discussion that will lead eventually to a statement of Association policy that the profession will support and make effective.   A basic assumption on which the statement rests is this: that the library occupation is much broader than that segment of it which is the library profession, but that the professional segment has responsibility for the definition and supervision of the training and education required by the complete range of activities encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians are not the only persons who work in libraries, but librarians are the ones who are concerned with the advancement and improvement of the library profession.  It follows then that it is the obligation of the professionals to engage actively in the establishment and maintenance of standards and norms governing the preparation of people who work at any level in libraries.  They should define and guide the kinds of preparation most useful at the pre-professional level and not merely the education of those who will hold positions at the level we now call \"professional.\" ",

        "text": "    As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936.   During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra. ",

Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of  relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity.

In this report, which is based on actual observations of on-the-premise use made of the Science Library, various statistics measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use are tabulated.  In addition there are some suggested measures of effectiveness of the library. A unique outcome of the survey has been the construction and verification of a mathematical model employing probability theory to measure rate and kind of use of library material together with length of stay of library patrons. Such models, characteristic of an operations research approach, give promise of furthering the goal of effective library management and planning. "

In order to consider the later problem, the question  of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is  associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity- judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general  difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their  relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human  relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is  therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article.. ",

Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the  basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured.. "

This is a function of the total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship,  similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a  storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be  particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication operations.. "

        "text": "    The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the  librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user  needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user  circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design, satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates  that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70  percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this  approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the  library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the  disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of  use by another..

        "text": "    Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can  afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond  the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a  citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list  those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search  requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular  attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation  entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature  of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of  potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These  relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested  categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation  requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application  from a citation index to physics literature.. ",

Its advantages are: (1) it  provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a \"weak  ordering\"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching; and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the  requester..

        "text": "    A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the  search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target  detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this  principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will  yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search  zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone  sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully  evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature  appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to  demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters  obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents  are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a  search over the remainder of the file.. ",

The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of  publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to  produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern  information which is entered into the master record for each title causes check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to  predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time  period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is  described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system.. ",

Questions were collected from eye  researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different  secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to  the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign  languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more  than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the  mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the  researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and  Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources.. MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual  searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than  other non-ophthalmologist searchers.. ",

This paper  considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the  users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a  closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both  the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs  within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to  simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is  the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are  discussed.. "

The effect of word frequency and  other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be found from first or second order relationships in our document collections..  There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations  and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations  and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in  retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches  between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing  matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of  the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus, however, offers better performance than statistical association methods.. ",

A computerized cost system was developed and operated for a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study  indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to  measure the operating performance of the center's production process..

For each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram  was drawn..    Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern  III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse  journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity  of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect  means..    Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in  building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams  indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..    The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of titles, are ranked for each pattern.. ",

The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a  framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data  which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which  indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display formats and command language promote interaction..

The method makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the  in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19 documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over  66,000 word occurrences.. Seventeen indexers representing eight different  information centers participated in experiments.. "

The later  permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of  origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other  kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of  photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer  time and materials are listed..

Experimental data on indexing  consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency, quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of  indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law of vocabulary distribution..

To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the  possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and  successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived,  measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality.. ",

Two judges (documentation experts) made  comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting to resolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures  used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seems better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to  rational discussion.. ",

In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model  of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal  applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of  its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in  a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that  this model can be the basis for the development of a \"true\" science of  information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use  of this model and the definition of a \"true\" science, the goals and requirements  for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this  context, information is defined as data of value in decision making..  Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to  specific observable actions which can be measured physically.. ",

Ordering of author' names as an adaptive  device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews  with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of  other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of  individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected  distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular  sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the  assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their  contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other  scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse  oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their  eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent  laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet  unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates'  contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to  their other research.. ",

        "text": "   The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important  determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science.  All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no  more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries. ",

        "text": "   In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users  remain nameless.   The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries.   Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.

Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow - is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes, but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books were unchained from the shelves.

We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical generalizations.

This form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing  another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under the new cultural relations program which the United States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America.

        "text": "   The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and  technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a  theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical  one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and  information services.   For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists  studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with  more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure.   One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by  behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized  sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information.  The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the  publics so studied. ",

        "text": "   The preceding papers have addressed themselves to the study of information flow in a particular stream of human activity which has been variously called science, pure science, basic research, or fundamental research, and which is only secondarily, if at all, concerned with the practical utilization of its products. At this point it is appropriate to note that there is a parallel activity which includes applied research, exploratory development, and engineering development. This second stream of research we will call technology. Far more is known about the flow of information among scientists than among technologists.  From the knowledge that is available, however, we are led to conclude that the communication patterns   in the two areas of activity are not only largely independent of one another, but qualitatively different in their nature.  This difference is reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by which information is diffused within the two sets of practitioners.  The present paper is addressed to these differences and to a discussion of the nature of the communication process between science and technology. ",

Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific communication as well as storage elements for the summary accounts of research undertakings. Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of information flow created by scientists in their work.  The potential usefulness of this type of investigation is increased when it becomes possible to examine the trends through time of the communication network under consideration, and also  when different communication networks can be compared.   The present paper deals with some of the characteristics of bibliographical citations in the same 21 psychological journals published both in 1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the American Psychological Association and 13 journals published by other organizations.

In an ecological correlation the statistical object is a group of persons.

When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that  history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled. ",

Therefore, the new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new  field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this  occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a  positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its  consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of  the human mind into an experimental science..

Although these two variables are highly correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and  other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the  community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system  operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert  the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a  higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments  than in the weaker departments..

As laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of  the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work  practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions  in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively  large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already  eminent..

Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists,  all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less productivity into a large network of influence and communication..

This selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of  the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and  clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application  suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences.",

A series of hypotheses were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was  predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of  communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data  collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were  found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and  satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political  scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger  numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields.. Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation  being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of  institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines..

Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with  a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of  accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases.. "

Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither  social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying  those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network  structures..

        "text": " The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientific publications has long been a major impediment to progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963; Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index (SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists' contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals.  The number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that individual's publications. ",

The effect of these decision rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations  are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is  applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative  distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries  and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation  data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdivided subject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all three libraries.. ",

It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that there are many activities and ideas outside of this context that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on library and documentation systems.

As disseminators, we are interested in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from one point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that \"the medium is the message,\" we must concern ourselves with not only the means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data, evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling their transmission to a target: the reader.

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases  is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects  of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems.   This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define  the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities.   In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information.  This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science. "

During most of this time, computer scientists have concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing power is made available through interactive terminals to people who are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become an important element in the design of the interface to the tool. ",

        "cross_references": "   The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\" issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations.   One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.

In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and \"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review.   \"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products. "

The international organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the second. "

This field, which will be referred to as \"Information Science and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use.   Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services. The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume, is to provide such a review. "

Besides, these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication.  While \"user studies\" have not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research has witnessed progress along the following lines:     Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application   of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in   this field earlier in less rigorous forms;     The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution   development records; comparison of research teams working on identical   tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before;    and     An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the   information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American   Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research   in this area.

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards and our means of professional communication.   The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering  automation of technical processes and the other covering document networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of value to anyone interested in the total communication process.    At the same time, \"core\" chapters of the review are continued:  information needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation; and professional aspects of information science. These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their annual literature is significant, large, and growing. "

Until the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly.   There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\"   This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue. Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science needs them both. ",

The basic objective - to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify, locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information about various aspects of our technical progress.   Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also, the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.

The increasing interest in and movement toward library networks and other cooperative, technology-supported information activities have helped to focus special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology, the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems, but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications. Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use information-handling systems.   Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems and information systems in state and local government.  While the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving techniques they are fostering.

Libraries have assumed the active role of serving the informational, educational and recreational needs of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing.   The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about. ",

Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this purpose.   The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented. Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.   Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions, develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.

Some have been based upon observations and records of what the scientists and engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions, and collections of facts. "

        "text": "   This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being  conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.   A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent).   Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.

Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three phases aimed at:     I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the       art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating       libraries developed up to the present.    II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from       Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already       published, or from any other sources, by which to develop       criteria.   III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.   Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings of the study. ",

Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world.

The study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature, and this has been reported elsewhere. ",

These arise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr. Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (Aslib Proceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field.   The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry' were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary.

A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.   One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information     systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed     for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an     attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting     them.   In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows. ",

But the subject indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing. ",

In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just  that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today. ",

This was published in the Journal of  Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits  of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results  which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review considers mainly British and American investigations.

        "text": "   When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information, very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are  a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much  smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in  scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field. ",

        "text": "   In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical  feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature.   At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia. All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five hundred profiles weekly. ",

        "text": "   Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable. By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.   The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis of this system and of its further development. ",

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to  opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information.

        "text": "   The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with  reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finite means\" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a \"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term.   This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions. ",

He asked what I am sure he thought was a relatively straightforward and easily answered question:  What are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials? On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploring the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national, multi-media information network, that would electronically integrate our colleges and universities, eventually providing each of them a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and educational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life into this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM). ",

There was never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted, concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's aegis was a suitable one.

As the strength of national professional associations of practitioners has increased, concern with education for the professions has prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to support the preparation of practitioners.  During the half century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed national associations.  The Association of American Medical Colleges, for example, was established in 1876.  Other professional school associations followed:  engineering (1893), law (1900), librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919). These associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels of influence in affecting professional education. ",

In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on \"The American Scholar,\" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor ",

The central theme of the work is a relatively new concept - the rise of an \"anthropological\" species we call the authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly  industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational  beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others, jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of socio-psychological research. "

Many people in the company were directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests that were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake. Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as employees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC has had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management was enthusiastic in its support of the new project. ",

        "text": "   This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussion of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not a textbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice of topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide an elementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally, in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument; but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this, or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.

I have limited myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed \"library housekeeping\" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing, periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries. "

These areas of concern (well known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing complexity of manual inventory control files; increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues  reasonably current and accurate; and increasing demands for a wide variety of services for a clientele whose needs for information have grown tremendously since World War II, and many of whom have only recently turned to large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an internal committee of the Library of Congress was charged to study potential applications of electronic data processing equipment to Library procedures; subsequently representatives of three computer firms made brief studies of Library operations which  intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially by automation.

Automation can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to completely replace man.    The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing. The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment, punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers, the latter playing the most prominent part.  ",

Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed  by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of the Medical Library Association.   This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself, studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).   After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J. Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges. ",

Based on cancelled charge slips collected at the Yale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made to interview those research investigators whose books has been returned the previous day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to a questionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if the book had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the  six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned were monographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted, and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade.. Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth being for lecture preparation.. ",

This paper, the  first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of  geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative  control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted.. Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and manpower..

        "text": "    As part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower, the universe of health-related institutions and programs (excluding hospitals) was surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library resources, indicating usage of some 2,207 non-hospital libraries.. Eighty percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was \"within\" their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was \"outside\" of their institution..    The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries' facilities, resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions, was developed..    It is concluded that projections of manpower needs should take into account institutions and programs not at present possessing health sciences libraries as well as documented demand in existing health sciences libraries..

The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citations and other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedical journals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by 246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a  substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed some reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with the imposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline.. ",

        "text": "    The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 - December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University of Virginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control and retrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line..    Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog..    The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an  inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations..    At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no  citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity..

        "text": "   For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the  references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.   Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined.  These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct    proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional    literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are    representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted    equally. ",

In the belief that a discussion of the latter may be of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review of investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here.   Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements. Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: to demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local situations the general use of books and journals.

The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin, the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an article on the use of the \"typewriting machine\" in cataloging.  Telephones have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.   Nevertheless, when the term \"machine methods\" is used for libraries today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.

Columbia received nearly 2,000 journals and Yale over 1,500; findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issues published from 1959 through June 1962.. This combined study of recorded usage for six months in the Columbia Medical Library (12.9 percent of circulation during January through June 1962) and for one year in the Yale Medical Library (12.5 percent of 1961/62 circulation) revealed that a core of 262 journals supplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid-1962 period.. However, it is probable that current issues of all titles received were used at least once within the libraries.. Titles of sixty-seven journals which supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed.. "

        "text": "    Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and  unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..    Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of  underlying information needs..    Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..    It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..

Approximately two-thirds of both books and journals used had been published during the most recent nine years.. A subject-by-subject examination of the ratio of books to journals circulating revealed that, in subject where proportionally more journals than books were taken out of the Library, books were of more recent imprint dates than were journals, contrary to the overall pattern.. Date distribution of books and journals by subject was also studied.. Results are illustrated with graphs and tables.. "

Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in terms of their use of material in individual subjects.. Subject literatures are analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them.. The extent to which journal titles used by medical students  are also used by Medical School faculty is examined.. One of the products of the study is a rank list of  journal titles used in the Library.. Results are presented in several tables.. "

        "text": "    The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid and misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial's contents nor the physical handlings or serial units, and is nonrepresentative of the in-depth library use of serials.. It fails utterly to report or even to suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. The actual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in the library situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulated analysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for the objective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use and physical handling of serials and the relating of resources.. Data gathering in the feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library's resources, are discussed.. ",

For the whole sample, citation list in  periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different sources of references was obtained..    Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of references.. "

In order to discover the actual terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also  included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world  to MeSH terms.. ",

        "author": " Garfield, Eugene ",
        "text": "    Many ongoing selective dissemination systems designers assume that the  librarian can be omitted from active participation in execution of the master plan.. ISI's four years of experience with ASCA service have shown that  librarians must be an integral part of the system and engage in a active  dialogue between users and the machine.. Specific examples of how  librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems are examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian should serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information media.. In this manner the librarian can filter and translate the requirements of individual scientists to conform with the inherent limitations of all machine systems while exploiting their capabilities to the fullest..

Both the RMLP and the Regional Medical Program are based on regional cooperation to enhance the value of  available resources, and to enable health workers away from main centers to  use them.. Services with Regional Medical Libraries must supply are described.. As this program develops, more than conventional library services will be provided..   Regional Medical Programs stress the continuing education of health-related personnel, and their need for health information; libraries are necessarily involved in such programs.. The regions of the RMP are smaller than those of  the RMLP, and the smaller regional focus may be an advantage..    Specific examples of the coordination of library services and library- oriented programs are given.. ",

With a short history of three years this network and its developing structure have exhibited most of the stresses of technology interfacing with customer groups, and of a structure attempting to build itself upon many  existing fragmentary unconnected segments of a potentially viable resource- sharing capability..    In addition to addressing these topics, the paper treats a design appropriate to any network devoted to information transfer in a special interest user community.. It discusses fundamentals of network design, highlighting that network structure most appropriate to a national information network..

The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8 million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract  mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has  been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction, regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. An assessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the  National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the  aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and information services to the professional health user.. The principal limitation has been inadequate funding to accomplish the level of originally stated objectives.. "

The primary test data are summarized  as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the  mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection,  processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular  library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables  can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status  statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions  of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this  work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision  aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and  further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical  Library Association.. "

        "text": "    The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive, manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the  monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the  system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is  examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff,  however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace  Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness  service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire  to continue participation in the service.. ",

We believe that, in order to understand contemporary economic decision making, we need to supplement the study of market factors with an examination of the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of organizational structure and conventional practice on the development of goals, the formation of expectations, and the execution of choices.

        "text": "   The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.   The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are  correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.  ",

        "text": "   In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.   We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest. ",

The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms, and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination.  A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer  in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional activities.

At that time the project, designed as a national service to alert scientists and technologists to current information in specific fields of research, was serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers requiring a total of more than three thousand five hundred individual computer queries.  Over one thousand personalized bibliographies are prepared each week from commercially available data bases purchased from Chemical Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and the British Institution of Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of the service was given in a paper by J.E. Brown published in October 1969.  ",

Neither has information been withheld to force readers tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context of a real library environment and against the background of particular institutional service objectives.

Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose between alternate courses of action without having adequate information. In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a consequence of this situation, the library administrators were considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could be designed and properly evaluated.

Only now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly  described.   It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of what seem to be the most important aspects of each.   Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States. Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful, that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging. I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism. "

The conference theme centered on the implications of cable television for libraries.  The general purpose of the Institute was to foster greater understanding about the subject of cable television in the conference participants.  More specifically, the planning committee for the conference enumerated the following objectives: 1.  to provide an atmosphere of inquiry focused on the implications of cable     television for libraries; 2.  to provide consultants and resource people who have knowledge and      experience related to the potential of cable television and its implications     for libraries; 3.  to expand the participants' understandings and perceptions of the     technology of cable television and its related equipment as they affect the      libraries' communications responsibilities; 4.  to suggest some techniques for utilizing cable television in originating      local programs, and to explore the possibilities for the varieties of     services cable television can offer the profession; 5.  to aid librarians in all types of libraries to become aware of the unique     possibilities for the utilization of cable television in their specific      types of libraries, and also to suggest the importance of cable television     in a systematic approach to library and information networks; and, 6.  to create a growing and continuing consciousness of the problems and     opportunities for the utilization of cable television in libraries.

        "text": "     This is the final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC) project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services.     This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles  encountered, and the solutions achieved.     Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system.  Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary objective of the project was to observe the  relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center.

When he became secretary, the association had already been in existence for forty- four years.  What kind of association was it that claimed Milam's allegiance? What experience had he had with ALA before becoming its secretary?  The answers to these questions lead to better understanding of Milam, the association, and their close relationship. ",

The output will be supplied in whatever form best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable tapes.

In using survey research to study these classic themes, we are also following the traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to us for the investigation of these problems.

This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly convenient way of arranging books on shelves.  Some librarians think it is, and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise. Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the next field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so  deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.

A few years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent, for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search, has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion.

To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority  completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the  questionnaire.

Law collections in academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general and special, academic and professional, in these countries.

It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to various American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional expenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the  catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method which he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves. ",

The classified form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue. Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal influence gained by its being taught to students of library science during the last twenty years.   While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for their applicability.  They are all of general application, irrespective of the scheme of classification in use. ",

But the public, generally, and even many librarians and book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unaware of the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under these conditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades the books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than 90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately, even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem, they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert advice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries. The present essay is intended to meet this need. ",

These formulas attempt to identify the principal factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to  specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further  research in needed..

The term relative usage was defined and  used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3)  year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An  attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent  variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to  identify monograph titles for storage..    A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to  gather opinions of library patrons..

When they go through librarians they  must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as  the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help him arrive at an understanding od his \"compromised\" need by determining: (1)  the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal  characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization;  and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the  reference librarian.. ",

An analogy between curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by  department, and then counting circulation within those groups..

The profile can be used as a selection tool, as a  correlating tool between curriculum, circulation and publishing, and as a  device to aid weeding and shelving..

To test this assumption the author hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books  left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books  charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within  finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments.. In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters  and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library  circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out  to in, and the regression equation.. ",

Its purpose is  to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however, will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming, simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations  research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in  this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard  techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations  researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian. "

These difficulties coupled with a  declining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning,  and an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to the declining status of the library director..

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.   This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" of intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason. "

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution..  Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain  unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.. Changes in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query,  update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored  information..    Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree- structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In  Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.. IN Section 2, certain operations (other than  logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.. ",

This process in most disciplines appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years - from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are cited in a review.  To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied, we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the major studies which were conducted for all disciplines.   We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order (1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000 scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.

We have included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however, so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups..    Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact, make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible..

        "text": "   Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content.   Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to  books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics.   My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity, and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised. I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear, however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success, whatever solutions ultimately emerge. ",

Current  approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective  beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on  dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars  and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the  invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis  and question answering..

        "text": "   In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems.   First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it.  This situation is, of course, well known.    Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these should be relatively few.  In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.   So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set. ",

        "text": "   The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to \"comprehend\" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a \"semantic network\" representing factual assertions about the world.   The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory.   Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind.   The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future. ",

A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to  implementation on storage devices.   This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages. .K  text searching, information theory, filed organization, direct access, information retrieval, character string, bit vector .C  3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6 ",

        "text": "   In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have improved the communication between librarians and the consumers of information on a national and international basis, and we have refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying information.  In addition, library education has been on the front line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of organizing and disseminating information of all types. ",

A replica of that  tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the  cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.

These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access. But the changes to be effected also have major social implications; the reasons for publication and use of information are complex, reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still  imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.

Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which  the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore  involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics..    An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to  substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in  dictionary look-up times and storage utilization. "

It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problems that have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate an understanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions and general recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of two parts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or the cost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is the more speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part. ",

At the least, the publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not  only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.

For two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques  of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest. "

Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified. "

        "text": "   This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries. This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear distinction for the purposes of this work.   Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries, and state library agencies are included in this category.   School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are included.   Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which, while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries, university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and  Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.   Special libraries are those directed toward making information available to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of nonprofit organizations are common examples.   While distinctions between research and special libraries are not always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no serious problems are created. ",

        "text": "   The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes,  methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing  documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors:   (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the  acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an  international scale.   (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has  resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.   The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the  great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were  discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been  powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for  a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results,  however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of  research materials as well. ",

        "text": "   This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various countries.   In order to make the differences existing between the various solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies,  printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details, such as punctuation,  capitalization, transliteration, etc.   In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language.   In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been  complemented by references to professional literature on the subject available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users' approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as yet paid insufficient attention to these problems.  ",

We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate   data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.

The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.   For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future.   The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole.

Rather, the approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He must consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate their implications for action.  Such an approach is designed to help us reason and act a bit more systematically - when we choose to do so! ",

The word \"inquiry\" suggests that the audience includes persons interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so on.

Researchers have predicted that all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved. Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to  permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well. "

Their  organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to- follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition, physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures. ",

Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service  studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries, no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history.   The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.   There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the  development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship. The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  It undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in research libraries. ",

For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its immediate predecessor.   Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.

(For this  reason, sociological concepts are defined when they are introduced.)   More than five hundred publications on the diffusion of innovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied range from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive tribes, and from driver training among public high  schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generally consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, a search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas. This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.  ",

The economists, with an already established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries of the machine technology that enhances their ability to construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at The City University of New York and at other universities.   The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently aware of these important resources.

In the absence of established standards or criteria for measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process; a survey of needs and interests of the target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move.   To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program.

        "text": "   More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term \"bibliography,\" but to which gradually the work \"Documentation\" was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed and non-printed documents.   The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill of all nations.   It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men, whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.   And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements.   Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts. ",

What types of households use the library?  Why do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an investment in a security system worthwhile?   We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library, our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public  libraries. ",

In particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided relationships explaining statistically the determination of such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the magnitude of their professional staffs.

The study will attempt to answer two specific questions: 1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a university need consider in adopting a storage program; and, if not, how is cost related to the others?   The facts and conclusions in this report are based on the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations in computer applications and other technologies could presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years.

Only theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal, thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national product, consumer price index, unemployment). ",

We believe that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.

        "text": "   The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years. It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one  field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the N.L.L",

        "text": "   Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements.   In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge. ",

Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time- sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and  consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric data.   Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination of information (SDI), and networking.   Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special  libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and  abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and  acquisitions.

        "text": "   Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation  of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore, citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not  vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used in subject indexes. ",

By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary, and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processing extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according to his own personal needs.

On this hypothesis, the aggregate of periodicals can be divided into classes according to relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce as many references as the more related classes.  The whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of successive generations of diminishing kinship, each generation being greater in number than the preceding, and each constituent of a generation  producing inversely according to its degree of remoteness.    The investigation covered, in the first place, the references quoted, in the course of four and two and a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are  prepared in the library.  The source of each reference being given, it was possible to arrange the sources in order of productivity, the results being set down in columns A and B of the table, in the previous column. ",

Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more  economical. "

In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in this book as \"document transfer systems,\" implying that the product being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern. The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing, an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape. "

The investigation is timely:  the Library is now planning a second-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS II should benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affecting the performance of the present system.

As new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs, both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been steadily rising. ",

In most cases this section consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.  In some cases there is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out in meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a few treasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlike plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked and why.  "

The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results.

My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society, together with the place of the library in it. ",

For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available.  That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge.   It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification. ",

Within the environment of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance, while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination. "

        "text": "   The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a factor of major importance. ",

The papers presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to the limbo of outworn dogmas.  ",

The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability.

What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication?  To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.

Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has gradually been elaborated by our research group.   We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics. This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart to the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the development of a new alternative. ",

        "text": "   Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.   The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential. It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect they will have on society.   These inventions include:   The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields ploughed by oxen.   The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000 simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.   The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory, has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls or their equivalent.   Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can become very low in cost.   On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.   Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers see as well as hear each other.   Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.   Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It could be used for signals other than television.   Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.   Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals.   Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this.   Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and \"concentrating\" all types of signals.   Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a fraction of a second. ",

These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the \"soft\" or human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit, the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.

Strange new subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex. ",

Concomitant with this development is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports, technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator, researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids been so little systemized.    The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately 400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.

The needs of these types of users have influenced the organization and make-up of this volume, in that the requirements of the first two groups have made the manual more comprehensive than it might have been if intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to sections and many of the annotations have been provided particularly for the library school student.

Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems. From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in this Handbook.  ",

The three chapters following are purely practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative study.  The last chapter is intended for teachers.   The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world. It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship students in the course of their project work, on replies to a questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world, and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a number of years.

        "text": "   The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods available for the application of modern data processing to library operations. For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data  processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and, particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems, as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a process that is already underway. ",

Where one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth. This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different from that of the first.   But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first edition.

It is doubtful if an author  has any control over which of these two types of books he writes, though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this. "

This study is less a descriptive history of library schools and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems, as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully understood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light on how library education at that time came to be what is was.  The present study continues beyond the early forming of the American library school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.  A new title is used to reflect the broadened scope. ",

The study is concerned with the integrated activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables. The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age. Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is, half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending over periods of days or years receive no attention. "

They determine also the quality of its successive generations of management.     Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management is:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate. ",

Since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A  statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the  statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the  establishment of a set of \"notions\" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the  recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern  for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search..

Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on,  and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then,  the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production  problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall..  This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project selection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination  problems..  Most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems separately.. ",

The model is constructed from literature-based propositions which make  explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the model.. Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional  laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need, problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the  opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative thought proposed by other investigators.. Finally, the organizational events, which were associated as \"needs\" events or \"means\" events for the ideas studies, are identified and analyzed with respect to both quantity and quality of ideas..

An experiment was conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts. The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain types of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend to support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.

The models are classified according to whether they are based on linear, integer, chance constrained, or dynamic programming.. Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in  detail.. The evaluation is on terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions; ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application.. "

Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and  type of information lost through scanning title listing only..    Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information  retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are  discussed.. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as  supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed.. ",

Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us; an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first impression and summary.

We designed the studies so that (a) the full spectrum of scientific communication media could  be explored, (b) the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies, (c) the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the  same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final  integration into the general body of scientific knowledge, and (d) the same  studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that  genuine comparisons could be made among them..

        "text": "    This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles  sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media, from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The  present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information  exchange by \"productive scientists\" two years after the publication of their  articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor  greatly increase their information needs..

Though problems of disputed authorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard their solutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton or Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods. While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes' theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore, large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill that gap. ",

The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical  implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a  mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact  retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose  stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not   mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual  level..

The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the  new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their  expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the  indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an  aid..    An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial set of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS  system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is  compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each  document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are  discussed in the paper..    The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information  retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an  estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer  time and indexer time.. ",

Both attempts only partially succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less precise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses the ambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" - presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken of the subjective relevance (pertinence).\"  Yet this is surely the true aim of the system. ",

        "text": "    An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be  extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of  employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph  theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different  cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The  clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to  determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..    Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance  were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the  retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters  and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and  the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or  other  situations.. ",

Situationally relevant items of information are those that  answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant  situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in  relation to questions of concern.. It is claimed that situational relevance is  an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance, and that it is  the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying  practically relevant information..

An algorithm is described for  determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments.. Its efficiency is  tested for a sample data base formed from the MARC tapes.. A certain threshold  frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct  fragments.. The selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to  choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base  by concatenation of non-overlapping fragments.. ",

Some of the fundamental characteristics of social science research and its literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information needs and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter 3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies in the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use made of information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches. ",

        "text": "   In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably  awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or  postscript to the original papers, the passages added have been italicized.  ",

I have therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.   The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately covered by other volumes in this seris.  Moreover, it is my contention that the importance of \"hardware\" and \"data processing\" aspects of information systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment to the performance of many systems.

Thus, hardware, materials, and processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first, in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship  and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine. Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have developed strongly since 1963.  ",

More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive..    Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are  investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's  theorem is proved.. ",

The two projects were rather different as to purpose, method, and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance). Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time, arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His curiousity about the real result of the reference activities (as different from merely counting the questions answered) led him to ask, \"Is there substantial difference between the claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual result as observed in a number of different situations by individuals posing as clients?\"  The study which followed from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this pair.

The book is addressed primarily to the researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his document collection or start an index to his document collection but does not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library), to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study).

The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated \"research\" and \"nonresearch\"..    A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present  in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel..

The first is the most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators. To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal  discussion.    The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic relationship.

This paper is devoted mainly to problems on the idea plane.     \"The IR-language I want to talk about, is the language in which the information to be retrieved is formulated, i.e. a declarative sentence language, not the imperative sentence language of the programmer-retriever\" (Bohnert in Samet, 62.1:10), that is, the information language should not be confused with the programming language.  (To avoid misunderstandings it would perhaps be better to say \"descriptive\" instead of \"declarative\" and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may be described which is, however, not to be executed by the system but to be retrieved by appropriate searches.)

The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings, as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes. ",

A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities  between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in  document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity  connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its  complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes  according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets  of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and  with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on  definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are  presented..

        "text": "    An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of  natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to  organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the  remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject  index is that to Chemical Abstracts..    It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it  appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was  first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to  generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more  prepositions or connectives..    A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject  index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been  developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to  greatest organization in the index display..    Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The  potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval  is examined.. ",

The system serves about 100 research scientists  and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with  those of a manual system is made..    Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to  external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an  external service on a wide scale..    The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and  organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main  problems which are likely to arise.. ",

The complete prototype system is now being programmed for  operation in a time-shared environment.. It is a user-oriented system, with  planned capabilities for the browsing and man-machine interaction.. A major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an  on-line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information.. Each  user-submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to  vocabulary or form.. The system converses with the user to obtain  source-derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry.. The use is led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as a further aid to request formulation..    Evaluation of system performance is described.. ",

        "text": "    Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information  retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the  determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents  which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid  evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..    A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance  assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure  retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information  science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the  relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall  and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision  data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many  distinct user classes.. ",

A mathematical model of a  search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account  is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct  method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method.. ",

It discusses the possible  characteristics of such classifications, and potential ways of using them; and  described the various approaches to classification we have considered, in terms of an overall frame of reference in which several types of classification are  distinguished.. The results of experiments using a collection of documents and test requests obtained from the Aslib Clanfield project are presented, from  which it can be conclude that automatic classifications which lead to noticeable improvements in retrieval performance over those obtainable with unclassified  terms can be set up..

        "text": "    The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all  and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance  purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive  basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining  and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are  proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and  exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of \"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the  principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not  achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms.. Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could  successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by  the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using  machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques.. ",

        "text": "    The economic merits of applying computers in information storage, retrieval  and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of  operating the information services concerned.. This had tended to indicate that computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in  the large scale organizations..    The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system  representing the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the  inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information  gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application in information work..    In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic  justification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize  the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..    To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in  research data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial  research establishment.. ",

        "text": "   The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with citations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competent to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view, therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a deficient system. ",

With different choice of  parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data  bases..    An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to formulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search  procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of  convenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so  that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in  a more convenient form..    In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be  dependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to  modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..

        "text": "   This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based on data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning and renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems. URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of literature which had been neglected by the information science community before the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.

        "text": "   Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social  development.   An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical  operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation, file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores. ",

Nine chapters, each from a different  technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the  first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of  syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it  proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting  techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria  in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding..  The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and  are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the  indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases.. There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be  produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items.. ",

        "author": " Schultz, Claire K. ",
        "text": "    To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the  course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions,  been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some  objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type  criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the  state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate  for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that  takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of  operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing  possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of  effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human,  machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of  criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of  effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of  defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete  steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and  small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..

Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature, automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived,  our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the  citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links  among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject  headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one  to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and  relevance ratios, close to 100%..

The system is highly flexible, providing for all the types of data elements which have been  used in both thesauri and subject heading lists, with additional features found to be useful as a result of the ongoing research program at Columbia.. Three thesauri in widely varying subject fields are in the final stages of production under the system.. As a result of the simultaneous development of the thesauri  (based on actual indexing universes) and of the production system, which is  part of a larger program of research in information handling problems, a variety of new techniques and procedures have been developed as their usefulness became  evident..

In these 5 years ARIST became not only a very much used and quoted  tool, but also an established institution.. This is testified by the fact that  each of the five volumes was the year's most frequently and most comprehensively reviewed book in the field.. The ARIST effort is unparalleled in great many  fields..    Currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to science and technology.. All sciences and technologies are subject to  questioning, scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject  areas..    Scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important  literature items.. With 5 years and five volumes ARIST invites and affords a  perspective.. This review is attempting in broad brushstrokes to be a critical  examination of the underlying structure, and literature base as well as the  achievements of the ARIST effort as a whole.. ",

The results showed that the selection criteria laid down  by Drugdoc are strictly adhered to; the mean time of alerting of an article  was 11-3 weeks after receipt of the journal at Wellcome and all articles from a particular journal issue were reported by Drugdoc on average within 13-6  weeks..

The total costs in  connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components: Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the  documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expenses connected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers.. They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts during sequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the  terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weight factors.. (The above documentation department belongs to the National  Technological Library of Denmark and also two SDI services based on tape  systems from CAS.. Retrospective searches have been carried out).. ",

We recommend the use of hash coding  for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system  should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the  opposite of the procedure in a manual search..

        "text": "    Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of  special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the  number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the  computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of  internal memory..    The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that  meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically  expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural  spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed  to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..

        "text": "    The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides information from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government and universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a  variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and a high degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 software system was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSC have run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware, computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All data bases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employs a directory and character string type of the structure..    User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with  any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base;  search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments; full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or  weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper, or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile and monitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency  list and KLIC indexes..    Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and  improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems, personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized  retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage, thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity, file preparation and cost effectiveness..

Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are  interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward  the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge..

The system, which permits the  free text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy  Abstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and  Stroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centers in the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for  information.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a  neurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The  results of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision,  and general user satisfaction.. A detailed analysis of factors affecting  the success and failure of the on_line searches was carried out.. ",

The model incorporates an objective function based on  expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which  account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the  librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function  can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information  retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to  be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial  operations..

Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of  a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two  interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in  order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored  information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form  of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of  angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed,  together with related studies of expansions and inference steps.. ",

Grammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human  screening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to an operational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of a dozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica.. In a batch mode, the programs to accomplish this indexing would require no more than fifteen minutes of CPU time per week.. ",

D can be expressed as a function of  Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets  of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for  retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and  constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D  are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system..  Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the metric are illustrated with seven examples.. ",

Some means of improving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format were investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts  presently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large  free-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios  generally observed for free text databases and the very high number of  references of potential interest retrieved..

In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of  agreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87  per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to  index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..    The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn from nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the other.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the  computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of  documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis  of subject content..    A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the  technique indicated.. ",

        "text": "    The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS  was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness  data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two  measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in  dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be  expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an  estimate of the recall ratio..    To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which  experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the  list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each  of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted  below..    (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant  searching operators..    (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to improving the cost-performance of the system..    (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation  and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these  factors will improve system cost-performance.. ",

        "text": "    The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always  be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search, particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot  dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the  methods sufficient for his personal file..    The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing,  operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival  power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of fundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a better understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently, even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in  storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to  make such operations more \"objective\" and formal.. Such a better mutual understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of  scientific communication.. ",

Additional text is provided in coded form so that the reader can more fully explore this technique and form his own opinion of the applicability and  versatility of this particular procedure.. The DDC method for subject indexing  is very close to operational status for a data base which grows at the rate of  two million words of text per year.. ",

        "text": "    LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring  on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business, industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of many computer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the  development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough  understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in  a customized form.. Each different application required a different package,  with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages were developed via suitable modification of modular system software to result in  products tailored to user idiosyncracies..    The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures,  and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line,  interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users..  Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing upon  cost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed.. ",

        "text": "    This paper describes a technical document center providing remote-terminal retrospective search capability and shows its evolution from the traditional  catalog card operation..    The system uses mini-computers for on-line input and editing of data and for production of announcements, and uses a commercial computer-utility/ communication network for retrospective searching.. A hybrid of microform and  computer storage was designed to decrease computer and line charges and to allow for security considerations..    Bilingual search capability in either of two models suitable for experienced users or novices is provided to a network of satellite libraries separated by  as much as 3000 miles..    A Selective Dissemination of Information service is provided using in-house  and foreign data bases and serving over 600 profiles of interest.. ",

The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special  retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be  established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are  accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be  built up by a form of \"learning process\" in the course of regular indexing..  The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search,  using the thesaurus-classification as a \"switching language\", and for automatic classification, are suggested as long-term aims.. ",

It is assumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and elementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random process theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder to meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity and capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory are quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory have made the major results more accessible than in the past. ",

I have therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.     The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately covered by other volumes in this series.  Moreover, it is my contention that the importance of \"hardware\" and \"data processing\" aspects of information systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment to the performance of many systems.

As might be expected, the special problems presented by serial publications made the task of developing an ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L. Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.   Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen, Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to  demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen- space and dubbing the happy couple the \"distinctive title.\" ",

Reality and knowledge are not represented by words or terms but by the meanings \"behind\" these tokens. A concept of, say, an object, a property of an object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal  statements on these as subjects and may therefore be defined as the whole of true and possible predicates that can be collected on a given subject.  It is from these predicates that the characteristics of the corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common characteristics in different concepts lead to relations between concepts, which relations in turn are factors for the formation of concept systems. Different kinds of relationships as well as different kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed out that an orderly supply of the elements for  propositions (information statements) on new knowledge requires the construction and availability of such concept systems. ",

        "text": "    As the formal communication system of science has become less able to supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?    Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the  information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the  studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will  describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose.. ",

The Workshop, sponsored by the Information Systems committee of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies, brought together a group of information scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They were provided in advance with a \"Challenge\" paper and with a number of papers prepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselves were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user interface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted making the substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience. This book is intended to accomplish that goal. ",

This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for and usefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolated areas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education, and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for health care.  A limited group of practitioners, students, and librarians is being given access to the system so that it will not be overloaded and rejected because of busy signals, and so that a variety of user groups can test it.

The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to  make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years'  training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the ground that he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; it is a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator. "

In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity. ",

Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.

These unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending libraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides  disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials. Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check in advance the lending policies before sending requests.     The major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists, especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories. Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current     acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.

But the library is also concerned with man as a  rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the  library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit in them.

The project, designed to investigate the applicability of the techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject indexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnic of North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales. The programmed instruction course, written during this project and used by students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of the programmed text.   Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Our intention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course of programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to  impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular system.

Extended into a general systems philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerly random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and philosophy.     This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the present Introduction to \"systems philosophy\" over a period of three years of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.

But it does assume that the reader - especially the reader whose educational background, like my own, is more in the 'humanities' than in mathematics and 'science' - is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect to the use of symbols and formulae.  Few subjects suffer more than linguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities' that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad universities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously, and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approach to language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more 'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection with advances that have been made in formal logic, computer science and automata theory.

        "text": "    The last ten years have witnessed the growth of an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race. All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls.    He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change:  universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand. ",

For the scientist who needs to locate particular items of scientific information and for the documentation specialist who must make them readily available, the organization and management of this huge and expanding store of information is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal. Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively. ",

        "text": "    Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential  decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does  not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..    The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into  account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the  patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..    Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit their practical application are discussed.. ",

The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association  between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations  (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list  of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard  for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and  arranged in the order of their relevance to the request..

The documents are then classified into these  derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated.. Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or 48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer  formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of  classification categories and a different computational formula.. The  experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document  classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when  executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification  technique.. "

Perhaps more importantly, it provides connections between raw, multivariant data and sought-for information without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data. The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given a collection of objects and a list of measurements made on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a property of the objects that is not directly measurable but is known to be related to the measurements via some unknown relationship?  The only assumption made is that similarities and dissimilarities among objects are reflected in at least some of the measurements.  ",

A threshold level T is applied to the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are greater than or equal to the threshold level are set equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero.   Three definitions are applied to the corresponding graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters. These are, (1) the connected components of the graph, (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and (3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the graph as described that show how insight may be gained into the term relations by varying the threshold levels and the cluster definitions.

        "text": "    Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors  of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic  generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the  automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the  original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which  various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop  criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract  can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to  the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called  the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted.. ",

A thorough discussion of decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature, outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the  cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents  via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An  example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and without document classification information..    Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification  analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem, incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation, which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many  researchers in this crucial area..

It is shown that the mechanical procedure is capable of achieving  simultaneous average relevance and recall figures above 80%.. "

The first stage describes an experiment that explores properties of the class of words that are not useful in conveying subject meaning and distinguishes them from those classes of words that do convey subject meaning to various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering properties of these words; the analysis is based on statistical properties alone, and techniques are introduced that may be of value in other areas of information science.  On the basis of the results of this experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply this model to indexing. ",

An interactive system requires a sequence of steps in which man and machine alternately take action.. It should also provide different levels of services to experienced and inexperienced searchers, recognize the difference between a narrow and broad query, furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched,  recognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint,  provide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the  searcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of  extreme significance..    An online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed and tested..

        "text": "    In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts,  the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was  designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for  planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their user communities..    This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings  of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the 14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were  monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within the journals.. ",

        "text": "    The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large  quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible.. As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user  needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a  documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two  most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for  some typical services.. ",

The fundamental character of the phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information- oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied, a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems for which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggested that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of  information be developed and implemented.. "

Results for Index Medicus  alone over a large set of questions gave a 73% screened precision ratio and a  47% recall ratio..

        "text": "    Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are  analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..    When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library..    It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable;  every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case.. ",

The first group consists of 78 c-v specialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title.. These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..    In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S. c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14% of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v  journals..    The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..

        "text": "    The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services, such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become increasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information.. The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..    The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948,  1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958, and 1968..    Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative since the advent of the KWIC index..   ",

The technique used, we are told with a nudge of superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to combine the information.   I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific Information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate, pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books, and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage  and retrieval of information, and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship.

The system is designed to handle large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on  command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations.. At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained librarians..    Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification; and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..

The major national problem is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data bases that will be readily available during the next few years..

A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main experiment the effect on performance of the following variables was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes, question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific.. It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..   ",

In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval  situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in  performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the  classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency..

        "text": "   The Curriculum Committee of the Special Interest Group/Education Information Science of ASIS is charged with the responsibility for determining the scope and characteristics of information science programs in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculum developments and course offerings.  To fulfill this  responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit reliable information concerning courses being offered relating to information storage and retrieval, information science and/or documentation.  The data requested included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses, textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which offered, etc.   Responses were received from 45 schools, providing information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which would examine the validity of the questionnaire results.   This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the field representing universities industry and government were brought together to participate.  Consensus was reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to the curriculum in information science and seven courses which constitute the core for the Master's program. The topics to be included in each of these courses were also isolated. ",

        "text": "    Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval.. Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..    The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components, and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases,  while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..    These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA) for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..    It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate basis.. ",

A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These  queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with  fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4  relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the  relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the  choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds.. ",

Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the information available in te system, remains one of the principal problems in information retrieval today..    In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a  hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely,  thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system..

New, active roles subordinate the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver and codifier of knowledge.  \"Information center\" bears analogy to \"economic center\" and \"transportation center.\"  Like these centers, its significance is in transaction.  The significance of a transportation center lies in routes to other centers.  The significance of an information center lies in communication lines to knowledge  producers and knowledge users.

        "text": "    A new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval (MEDLARS) and automatic text analysis methods (SMART).. The results obtained  with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacement of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output  normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. When automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the  SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained  by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user  feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS  output of 15 to 30 percent..     One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining  controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments.. ",

        "title": " The Development of a Semantic Differential to Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive Reference Retrieval System ",
        "author": " Katzer, Jeffrey ",
        "text": "    A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..    Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor  analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was  labeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over  17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..    In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD.. The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure and the need for a predicative replication of the study..

        "text": "    The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the \"information explosion..\" However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact, an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods.. ",

As previously shown,  one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for 1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstract journals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300 cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used to gather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300 articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this four-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during the third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation were noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author,  15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic  journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of the citations were found in these journals.. Although the citations were found throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, a relatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals.. "

The Science Library contains some 220 physics journals.. The study reveals that only 138 journals (62.7%) were used even once during the 3 1/2-month interval.. A core of 49 journals supplies 90% of use, and these items would cost 51.1% of the total single subscription costs of the 138 used titles:  52.3% of use occurs in journal volumes less than 6 years old.. English is the most used language of physics journals and the English journals account for 95.3% of use.. American journals, 57.2% of which are published by the American Institute of Physics, supply 59.4% of the total use.. "

Through  the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs.. In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level and for a given cost per unit of user and system time.. ",

The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index.. A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary journals as cross field information links.. The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry --> biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..    ",

Epistemology is used as a prescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems of  epistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history of epistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived of information and of models..    It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be made scientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systems analysis..    Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the models are presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of future experiments..  ",

(Ei) on 1 May 1970, only 4081 were being monitored by two or more of the services..    The extent to which all three or any two of these services select the same journal article for coverage was determined by examining each service's selection records for the July 1969-June 1970 issues of these 4081 overlap journals.. The maximum possible journal article overlap among BIOSIS, CAS and Ei was found to be 822 articles and between BIOSIS and Ei, 1428 articles.. The journal article overlap between BIOSIS and CAS was found to be 48,856 articles and between CAS and Ei, 21,583 articles..    ",

It brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy to use.. The tabulations show the importance of co-workers in informal communication.. Low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was apparent.. The main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to use in the treatment of his patients..

Because the hypothetical methodology is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure.. This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..

        "text": "    It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance rules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, there are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently,  most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to  investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted..  The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing no  reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating of a thesaurus.. ",

        "author": " Jones, Kevin P. ",
        "text": "    It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..    Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems.. ",

        "text": "    The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users' needs studies by the representative small group technique; the analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority;  the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable existent information storage and retrieval system from those available;  the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final design of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from earlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..  ",

        "text": "    A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citation frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical  entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature of particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ  significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree generally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-cited papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science.. They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI  profiles.. ",

        "text": "    It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis.. But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:\tHow can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by experimentation.. ",

The JCI consists of journal by journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal processed in the SCI.. Two-step citation maps linking the clusters are presented for each  discipline..

At BIOSIS, development of such a system from the pragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self-supporting retrieval service from a data base of more than two million references has resulted in focusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need into an effective computer search specification.. Developed under CPS and now implemented under CICS, the program claims no novelty of structure or  technique, but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primary emphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeable about the structure, indexing language, and detailed content of a machine based references file..

Other units of size for obtaining densities, and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronous obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies to densities of use..     It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of different journals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses of raw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading,  until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each  group examined..

A central theme of every conference that I have attended related to:  \"What is information science?\" Or \"Is information science a science?\" In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by saying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and man's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for understanding is the greatest challenge of the science..    I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the scientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is the scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to the present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceive to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand the phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity be speculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can prove my assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed.. ",

Differences in their performance are correspondingly great..    The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry, these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language text..      "

Unfortunately, many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness, and the more refined procedures are computationally unattractive..    A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text  words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents of a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on how much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given  term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those which achieve the greatest separation..     The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns  a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and  phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..  Experimental results are  given showing the effectiveness of the technique.. ",

Industrial value analysis/engineering methodology is described and related to assessments of information products and services.. The state-of-the-art of evaluation study in information science is analyzed with  respect to 1.the scope of evaluation studies; 2. the use of laboratory-type environments; 3. the use of surrogate judges; 4. selection of variables; 5. frequency of study; and 6. comparabilty of study results.. Evaluation study is seen as essential to the management of information centers and systems and as having approachable growth potential.. ",

The emphasis placed on direct  access by the practitioners in the field, rather than delegated searches through information specialists, leads to the growing need for an efficient design in  training transient user groups.. Printed manuals, live help, audiovisual  presentations and on-line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of success.. The author contends that the use of computer-assisted instruction in  conjunction with the on-line information retrieval system is the most promising form of instruction in that the medium itself, as well as the message may be  used to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user/system  interface..

        "text": "    The problem studied in this research is that of developing a set of formal statistical rules for the purpose of identifying the keywords of a document--words likely to be useful as index terms for that document.. The research was prompted by the observation, made by a number of writers, that non-specialty words, words which possess little value for indexing purposes, tend to be distributed at random in a collection of documents.. In contrast, specialty words are not so distributed..    In Part I of the study, a mixture of two Poisson distributions is  examined in detail as a model of specialty word distribution, and formulas expressing the three parameters of the model in terms of empirical frequency statistics are derived.. The fit of the model is tested on an experimental document collection and found to be acceptable for the purposes of the study.. A measure intended to identify specialty words,  consistent with the 2-Poisson model, is proposed and evaluated.. ",

The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the  experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for  efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest  to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well.. Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was found to be relatively unimportant.. ",

        "text": "    Information science emerged as the third subject, along with logic and  philosophy, to deal with relevance - an elusive, human notion.. The concern  with relevance, as a key notion in information science, is traced to the  problems of scientific communication.. Relevance is considered as a measure of  the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a  communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge.. Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different  points in the process of knowledge communication.. It is suggested that there  exists an interlocking, interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances.. ",

A systematic approach to indexing in depth, based on earlier work and        resulting in reasonably consistent indexing..    2. An analytical approach to word forms in which the following categories        are distinguished:       ACTION forms; MEANS-material; MEANS-machine, and MEANS-man forms; STATES;       VARIABLES; and LATENT PROPERTIES.. For each word, those forms included in        a certain category are represented by a single code.. The        category-switching caused by prepositions must be taken into account..    3. Criteria for term-splitting with limited semantic factoring.. Occasionally,       semantic integration is used..    4. Critera for dealing with antonyms, which are classified as reciprocals,        complements, unequivalent opposites, diametrical opposites, and        reversals..    5. Introduction of conditional cross-referencing..    6.  Recognition of multiword synonyms as the major difficulty in coordinate        indexing.. ",

However, they may remember a surprising amount of such \"nonstandard\" information as the color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this type of \"nonstandard\" information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many situations.. ",

For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of the written technical information items that they received; 4 months later they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful,  and in what ways..    The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item \"useful\" even if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some significance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks,  the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3)  no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable, physical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove useful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item,  but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher's mind or a \"free association.\"    Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher..

The following recommendations are made for the guidance of authors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be both helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in secondary publications and services..    Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings, and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph,  and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document.. Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so that readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State the purpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either in that order or with initial emphasis on findings..    Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information and tone of the original document..  Keep abstracts of most papers to  fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words (preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer than 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally employ complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person.. Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and symbols the first time they occur in the abstract.. ",

The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability..  The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance..    The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely on the \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected..    Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..

        "author": " Doyle, Lauren B. ",
        "text": "    The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine searching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..    The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100 keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the range of one through eight words per document..    Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical problems to be faced are outlined..       ",

        "text": "    The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespread technical problems, affecting almost every large professional group,  corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in  computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year,  and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information  retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material..    Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions  have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention  has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..    We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for..

        "cross_references": "   Such phrases as \"information flow\" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to porterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power required for signaling, Shannon's Selective Information, changes in the state of one's personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages,  social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so on.  These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions must be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow. In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation.   \"Flow\" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair. Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow, according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to achieve the flow. "

        "text": "   This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location).   The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures for the compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the control parameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts with manually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposed components dominate the frequency component in the production of better  extracts.   KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentence  selection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words, key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, research methodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation.

Thus a general theory of epidemics can explain the growth of symbolic logic from 1847 to 1962.  An epidemic model predicts the rise and fall of particular research  areas within symbolic logic.  A Markov chain model of individual movement  between research areas indicates that once an individual leaves an area he is not expected to return.

Other methods, among which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must  have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code.\tCodes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would relieve the chemist of considerable burden. ",

Accordingly, we studied and then developed a chemical structure storage and search system.  Huber gave a good review of the various approaches and applications.

A major purpose of the CAS registration process is to determine whether a particular structure has already been stored in the system.  The ability to make this determination makes it possible to utilize a computer to assign to every chemical structure a unique identifying label.  This identifying label, referred to as a registry number, is the thread that ties together all information associated with a particular compound throughout the developing CAS computer system.  It is because of this  association, made possible by the registration process, that CAS will be able to provide multiple-file correlative searches with assurance that all information on file for a particular compound has been located.

Briefly, the concept of the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2) chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4) applications.  With the importance of compounds in correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System, for handling compounds must be the first step in the actual operation of an over-all computer-based service. The Registry System will include files of compounds  interconnected with files of associated data that permit identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the files.  ",

A tape record containing information sufficient for a computer to  calculate an atom-bond connection table for a chemical structure is obtained by typing the structure in any order solely from the keyboard or by use of the reader with prepunched tapes containing frequently occurring substructures.

A study of systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting  names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature, but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the preparation of computer programs is now under way.  ",

The system is intended to monitor a large scale experiment in file organization for a real-time, interactive chemical information system.  It is based upon a topological screen system that ensures the inclusion of every compound atom (including H) in at least one screen assignment, that appears to be responsive to a broad range of query types, and that is amenable to random- access techniques.  The Monitor system is also considered, in this paper, as an independent interim approach toward fulfilling, in an effective and economic manner, the functional requirements of a small- to medium-sized chemical  information system.  Thus it could be used to encode and generate structure files, to assign search screens, and to provide manual substructure search capability via microfilm or hard copy printed indexes.  ",

Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts, in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser Line Notations (WLN).  Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts. Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been  completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the  tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper  describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems employing \"word\" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments. Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches which do not require computer manipulation. "

A creative index is achievable if the relationship and association of things and actions, one to another, can be communicated as a continuous function vis-a-vis the real world of science and technology.   A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example, ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely a word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It is a concept that he associates with or relates to a product, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a property, etc.  It is within the semantics of his conceptual needs that he would like to use an index to  retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than documents, however, from the index.  He wants the index to direct him to those documents which are pertinent to his problem.  He wants the index to help him to generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations. He wants the index to help him in terms of his language, logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific  approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the ability to browse among the terms to discover the term that is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his memory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy if it is to be a creative medium of communication.  ",

Because none of the available computer search programs met the criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of data bases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape format was developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the same computer program.  The center was designed to provide current awareness and retrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerized data files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at many installations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler  language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.  The objective of  education and training led to the development of a \"Search Manual\" for profile preparation, the development of a workbook in \"Modern Techniques in Chemical Information,\" the teaching of a new academic course, and the presentation of seminars.

An associated front end allows a chemist to communicate with the programs by drawing structures on a Rand Tablet.  The WLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previously existing file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognize situations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLN or a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general, correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than one nonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ring  systems.  The philosophy and concepts behind these programs are explained along with the more interesting algorithmic results.  The role of the WLN-generation programs in a developing NIH chemical information system is briefly discussed. The WLN programs are written in Fortran IV and have been developed on a  PDP-10 computer.

While remaining generally within the framework of IUPAC and other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended names have been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structural diagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machine editing of index names and translation of these names into structural representations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aided by the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all \"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplification of general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment for certain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementary particles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventional chemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previous Chemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisons are made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituent radicals.

Use of the IUPAC cipher has proved  advantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching.  For most searches, scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has proved adequate.  Our computer programs also enable conversion of ciphers into atom- connection tables and generation of fragmentation codes.  The integrated use of these facilities and their merits relative to other approaches are discussed. ",

Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected.  To allow a completely general  specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures.   Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed.   This report is a condensed version of the original, which gives a generalization and comprehensive description of the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics, and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.

Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been integrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atoms  and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately  identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented. ",

Little attention has been paid to the behavior of the scientist (chemist) toward the learning process and the role of the literature in that learning process.  The ACS has gained some insight into this behavior and thus urges caution before one leaps to the uncritical conclusion that the literature as now constituted is dead but has not yet fallen over.  What seems more likely, when human behavior patterns are considered, is that the new and the old will co-exist side by side for several generations, and that the system's current emphasis on completeness will be replaced with selective compression.

User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly        improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime   importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the  reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them. ",

These are attributed to the fact that as the literature has expanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met by printing and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers. A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broad circulation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion,  in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to such a system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals be developed in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm  editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompany communications.

The survey results indicate that the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of the faculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia, with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each search question.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantial contribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions  being a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subject coverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as a result of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to the primary literature and increased use of library resources as they had been made aware of new sources and media - e.g",

        "text": "   The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is the machine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts in Chemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlier paper, we described the development of an experimental selective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) service based on these tapes.  A detailed description of the techniques of profile construction for searching a Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given in this earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluation of the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measures of retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also of user reactions to the service, as expressed in their replies to a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used to identify the reasons for retrieval failures and possible methods for improving retrieval performance.  A fuller description of the evaluation has been published in report form. ",

For purposes of comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  The results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4. The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself.  In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields.  More than 38% of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry are to various American Chemical Society publications. In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than 45% of the citations are to Society publications. "

        "text": "   In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of the National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council, recognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly created a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its impact on chemical information.   The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was to survey organizations that generate and/or process large data bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in which one can view a data base as being large.  It can be large in terms of having a large number of entries or records (or bibliographic references).  It can be large in the sense of having a large number of fields or data elements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can be thought of as large in the sense of having a large number of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be large in the most readily understandable sense of having a large number of characters in storage.

It then addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has  recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational cost and performance statistics are not yet available. ",

Substructure searches on CA Index nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological searches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of searches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain nonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance data can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall and relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possible for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct nomenclature profiles for many questions. "

        "text": "    A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very,  more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator  which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..    To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate  representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as  complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..    Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I,  e.g",

But present formulations of the Bradford distribution demand penetrating search for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application.. The present  paper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf distribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of the 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results,  certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of  journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..    It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is  required when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large collections, when 'saturation' of the most productive journals occurs..

Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader in bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectures were published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitly recognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on the history of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of the processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production of literature to international developments).

The idea of this was certainly not new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not- Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has four qualifications to the basic statement. "

It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural language, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the different branches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminological consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for determining the degree of terminological consistency.   The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines - are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current developments and thus points to the source of natural language. ",

From a  discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the  only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from  empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of  the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility..

Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering.  Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve.  Kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford. ",

        "text": "    The foreign-language barrier facing British scientists is a function of a, the amount and value of foreign scientific literature produced; b, the  linguistic ability of the people wishing to read it; and c, the availability and effectiveness of translation services.. To obtain quantitative data on  these points the NLL has recently conducted a survey amongst scientists and librarians in the United Kingdom and the present paper presents the more important results..    The survey has shown that the language problem is of considerable magnitude and is common to the majority of scientists and technologists.. The languages creating the most difficulty are Russian, German, and Japanese.. It has also  indicated that local translation facilities are not particularly effective and  that, as far as national facilities are concerned, British scientists are  largely unaware of existing services which might help them to overcome their  difficulties..    The results of the investigation suggest a number of lines of action which  the appropriate authorities might follow..  The most important would seem to be the publishing of a international index to translations and the creation within  the United Kingdom of a centralized Japanese translation service.. ",

This paper discusses the variable of 'implicit use orientations' - the particular attitude taken by a subject (judge) about the intended use of a document.. One hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information  requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each  adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked  effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use  orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of  another..    Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system.. This judgements have usually been accepted at face value and have not been subjected to  critical scrutiny.. There is reason to believe, however, that as ordinarily obtained, they may be unreliable and sensitive to a number of conditions of measurement that have not been carefully controlled in previous evaluation studies..

This has taken the form of research into methods of classification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to using the classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannot claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able  to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have, however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of research. ",

The conclusions or their generality may sometimes be invalidated by special conditions in the survey sample, by the environment having been disturbed  by the survey, by the interpretation given to questions or observations, or by the way the data has been analyzed.\tThese same factors make direct comparison of results from different surveys difficult, and make superficial comparisons misleading.  Some comparisons and conclusions are certainly much less sound than the casual reader might suppose, particularly when results have been compressed and taken out of their context in the original survey. The difficulty of comparing information-use surveys is well illustrated by the copious footnotes used by Menzel, Lieberman, and Dulchin in order to qualify the significance of the results which they compare.

The aim was to assess the effect, if any, of the considerable  measures taken since the 1962 survey.. Uncontrolled factors, mainly related to the rapid expansion of the University, may. however, have effected the results.. It appears that, except for social science students, there were few improvements in attitudes and use, and that seminars had little measurable effect.. Possible  explanations for this are offered, and the place of reader services in a  university library discussed.. Other items covered by the survey include the use of libraries in Halls of resinence and of Southampton Public Libraries, which in  both cases showed a sharp decline since 1962, the number and cost of books  bought by undergraduates, and their use of libraries in vacations..

        "text": "    In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests on the coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described. Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensive bibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstracts journals via the author indexes to determine the number of references given in the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subject indexes to try to locate those references which are known to have been  abstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the results are reported here.    Our results are presented below in the following form: 1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,    reports, etc.). 2. Abstracts journals consulted. 3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number of    references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on. 4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column    showing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are given    they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual    numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns. 5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings under    which references were found in the subject index.  Some references we    were unable to locate, so there is often an apparent discrepancy with the    figures given in 4. ",

It is used also to  explain differences among various literature studies of the past in terms of differences in subject and comprehensiveness of search.. The model is derived  from S.C.

There may be several alternative paths we can follow in order to serve user needs.. The problem is to determine the most economical path to follow.. Pay-off factors, break-even points, and diminishing returns must be taken into  consideration.. This paper considers some of these factors in relation to various parts of the complete retrieval system: the acquisition subsystem, the indexing  subsystem, the index language, the searching subsystem, and the equipment  subsystem..

Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen years old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  The net increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwise be expected.   Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.   Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on average be adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information) by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main theme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.

Several considerations outside the score of the  usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, a variable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to an extension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships between parameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such a useful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout.. A more powerful alternative to Cleverdon's 'inevitable inverse relationship between recall and precision' is proposed and justified, namely that the recall-fallout graph is convex.. ",

There were marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of organizations and although the overall 'half-life' of the literature proved to be 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another..    Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared with scientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of abstracting and indexing publications..    Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list of title requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexing  publications cited five or more times as sources of references..

This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes, in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded discourse and behaviour appertaining to it.   In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the cumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is, the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type of behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations appropriate to the particular fields.  Thus it has received many names  according to its exponents, in both senses of that word. "

As these photocopying services are legally obliged to  operate at cost, they offer significant economies to any special library which  exploits them systematically..    This paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings  that can be made, or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at no additional cost, by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the  peripheral periodicals relating to any well-defined scientific or technical subject..    Though photocopying charges must be realistic, the confident exploitation of  the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps in photocopying charges.. ",

Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during which one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerous studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the 'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate measures for discriminating between different subject-fields.

        "text": "   Thirty years or more ago, a favoured question in examination papers for librarians was some variation on the theme 'Compare the merits of a classified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue'.  This was a subject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length, advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits, without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote:       Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is     essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  May     the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts     of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems     of the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if     we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the     benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the     intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and     costs.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if we     are willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigid     intellectual discipline. ",

Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

        "text": "    A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted  classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific,  technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the  integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears both in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements  this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships  which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word  forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers..  The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement  and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in  certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the  techniques employed in its compilation.. ",

It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each  participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are given unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any other participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from  differences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of  incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for  each.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include  those that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint  system presents no additional problems.. ",

        "text": "   The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Director of Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S. Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of Scientific Information published at the end of 1966.  An English translation was circularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper, they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by Professor J.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information in which Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation', 'documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.   Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that  Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information, only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitions for 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity', 'information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up their proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, and the title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal, which is now called Informatiki.

        "text": "    The performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred  references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each  of a number of queries.. A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not  practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another measure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting  a query to the retrieval system.. The properties of this measure are examined  and it is applied to 315 MEDLARS searches.. ",

Unless a  correction for growth is applied, half-life fails a simple test of suitability, as do Brookes's aging and utility factors.. Results based on cumulated data have other important disadvantages.. Relative 'use-per-item' figures are  satisfactory.. The need to relate terminology more closely to the facts they represent is stressed: item-consultation decay rate, and 50% consultation  probability age are suggested and defined.. In the context of citation studies, item-citation decay rate and 50% citation probability age are equivalent and  avoid similar objections..    In data from NRLSI, item-consultation decay rates are only approximately  exponential.. Different rates are demonstrated for updating and basic searches, for academic and other types of readers, and for types of literature.. For some historical searches negative decay rates were found in the NRLSI and BML.. ",

The system has operated for more than a year at the Agricultural Division and is currently in use at five other locations.. Flexibility of the package is demonstrated by the variety of applications..    This paper outlines the various applications and shows how a single package may be used complete, or in part, or with modification.. Machine costs are given for the major application..    The system was designed with the possible input of externally produced  machine readable data in mind.. The intended application of the package in conjunction with tapes such as those of the Institute for Scientific Information source and Chemical Abstracts Condensates is outlined.. "

This divides the file into retrieved and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring  references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many  relevant references as the Boolean searches..

The survey has already been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one  library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library, the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available..    They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers,  the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc"

        "text": "    The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term  meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are  examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that  matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable  improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.. ",

The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status, and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of failure for different groups of volumes..   A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..    The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with  its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These  differences were reflected in the results obtained..    It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by  librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own libraries.. "

A simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step to determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user  behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to drawing together some threads of research of potential application in university libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here, since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere. ",

'Document analysis' is here understood in following sense: the extraction of meaning of documents - in the present case written documents.. We could  define the latter without reference to the usual distinction between 'scientific literature' (the object of document analysis in information science) and other kinds of texts - historical records, myths, folklore, sacred writings, etc.).. Indeed, one of my theses in that there is little hope of understanding the kind  of intellectual operations involved in the analysis of scientific documents, or questions pertaining to them other than through a study of textual analysis in  general, as carried out in many disciplines - history, sociology, cultural anthropology, exegesis. etc. (Gardin, 1969).. For the purpose of this  presentation, however, I shall concentrate on the handling of  scientific  documents in the first, narrower sense, and only refer to other categories of  texts in so far as they have been submitted to analytical processes of a  comparable nature..

        "text": "    The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and  large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and  biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great  difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To  cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review  of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the  impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately  than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the  predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort  today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to  size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which  should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in  relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information  content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of  presentation..    The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to  Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested,  namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a  scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in  increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that  the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers  in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their  significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..

        "text": "    In the course of the survey covered by this paper, cost data were collected by visiting eighteen operational computer-based systems in Europe and the USA, using a structured cost analysis scheme.. The sample included data-base  producers and self-contained systems that both create, and provide services  from, a data base..    From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations,  and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed..    Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by  factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff, than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods,  or computer programming..    The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to show the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads.. ",

This concern is both the result of, and a reaction to, growing pressures from within and without the library profession to adopt the tools of the management sciences.  The pressures are generated by many factors including the success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by the organizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit character of competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and critical nature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technology and by formalization of library networks.

This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived from a study of natural language, developed out of research into  principles for a new general classification.   PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system. ",

        "cross_references": "   While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it, certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the fundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash between OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only). Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.

The study determined who uses each publication, how much, for what purpose, and with what degree of success.  A major purpose was to discover how valuable the publications are to users and what impact they have had on their own research or professional practice as well as on their information seeking behaviour.  Comparisons are made between the results for the two publications.  Some conclusions are drawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community and on requirements for effective current awareness services in this field. "

There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high  proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are  now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD  shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them  well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large  circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small.. It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the  BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on  libraries..

        "text": "    In traditional classification schemes, the universe of knowledge is broken down into self-contained disciplines which are further analysed to the point at which a particular concept is decated.. This leads to problems of:    (a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..    (b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..    (c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that it         fits as logically into one discipline as another..    Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept is notated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..    The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, every  concept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquires the notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, the final class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamental  relationships between concepts..    Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can be  seen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles and  Attributes as its vocabulary.. ",

Management information in a library is of greatest use  in comparison, either internally, or with data from other libraries.. A simple, standard method of recording and costing is urged, so that librarians may  readily identify procedures requiring improvement..    Development of the present costing method is traced from its original state as a simple management information system based on exception reporting (i.e. reporting the exceptions which occur in any particular survey), through a pilot  study in a large university library, to its full installation in two further  university libraries.. The method of analyzing the raw data is described, and examples of the tables are given, together with brief background information on  the libraries concerned..    After a note on the limitations of the present costing method and of unit  costs in general, unit times and costs are given for numerous operations in  both the libraries surveyed, covering both reader and technical services.. There is agreement between results of several American studies and those of the  present investigation.. For further comparison, the information on times and salaries has been used in conjunction with a standard civil service costing procedure.. ",

        "text": "   Between 1969 and 1971 Bath University Library experimented with a personalized information service to social science researchers at the Universities of Bath and Bristol.  The principal service offered was a manual current awareness  service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals. The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each reference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The relevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high  priority among the various possible claims on university resources.  Those who had the closest contact with the information officers had the best scores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly.  Some general observations on the place and value of an information service in a university library are given in conclusion. ",

Described are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable  form, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing  of the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author title catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are  issued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is  the abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of  entries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols  employed to alter this order, and problems encountered..

This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment decision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used  in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of  capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and periodical titles).. It may be that the break-even point in terms of collection size required for successful automation of serial records is smaller than has  been assumed to date.. ",

        "text": "    Under the auspices of the International Federation of Library Association's Committees on Cataloging and Mechanization, an International Working Group on Content Designators was formed to attempt to resolve the differences in the  content designators assigned by national agencies to their machine-readable  bibliographic records..    All working papers emanating from the IFLA Working Group will be submitted to the International Standards Organization Technical Committee 46, Subcommittee  4, Working Group on Content Designators..    Prior to any attempt to standardize the content designators for the  international exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, it is  necessary to agree on certain basic points from which all future work will be  derived.. This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that  presently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the IFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term \"content designators\"..    If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatly  facilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic records issued by other national agencies.. It should also contribute significantly to  the expansion of MARC to other languages by the Library of Congress.. ",

A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results        beyond the ability of any one of its members.     2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that        allows it to establish an identifiable domain....     3. It has a base in communications technology. ",

What they are, what impact they can have, what influence      they currently are having on serials processing.   2. Standards Setting Projects. I will attempt to describe and/or define      the almost incestuous intricacies of the National Serials Data Program      (NSDP), the International Serials Data System (ISDS), and CONSER      (CONversion of SERials).   3. Code Revision Activities.  I will outline the influence that current      standards and projects are having on code revision activities.   My comments are to be considered within the context of conventional libraries, primarily one wherein card catalogs still exist and manual processes are the rule. ",

Studies which resulted in the determination of the indexing requirements of research physicists, new methods for the content analysis and indexing of physics research papers, and better production methods for journal indexes have formed the backbone of the work which has as its ultimate objective the creation of a reference retrieval system  which is adequate for the physicists who will use it.

The molecules were represented  by three types of substructural fragments, the augmented atom, the heteropath,  and the ring fragments.. Of the two pattern recognition methods used to predict the activity of the test compounds the nearest neighbor method predicted 83% correctly while the learning machine  method predicted 92% correctly.. The test structures and the important substructural fragments used in this study are  given and the implications of these results are discussed.. ",

        "author": " Svenonius, Elaine ",
        "text": "    This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given  collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by  nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using  the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the  usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the  statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the  \"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for  the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never  improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest that  title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior.. ",

The rise to a higher level of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought about an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional degree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research is curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced librarians.

Mono-Dicraredical Classification systems were developed for this purpose which made it possible in each case to find a single clearly defined category for each bibliographic item.  The development of modern science has brought about two principal changes in the situation:   First it is no longer enough to simply provide for the retrieval of complete bibliographic items as a unit, but rather one tends more and more to request informational details that may be contained in the book. Second, modern knowledge has become too complex and interdependent that it is  no longer possible to provide a single well-defined category for the books or journal articles. ",

The first is an attempt to evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based on research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second is devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on the study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion of directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years. The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, and the future. ",

Do you know that only 39 states have statutory provisions for county law  libraries?   Do you know that seven states have no listing for county law libraries in  the American Association of Law Libraries 1968 Directory of Law Libraries?   Do you know that Los Angeles County, California, not only has the largest  county law library collection in the United States, but it also has seven  branch law libraries?   These four questions readily point out the simple fact that the growth and  development of county law libraries in the United States has been uneven,  without pattern or standards, not only on a State-to-State basis, but on a  county- to-county basis within a particular state.   A survey of the 39 state  statutes relating to county law libraries reveals that there are no two states  that have exactly the same method for the establishment, administration,  financial support, or maintenance of a county law library.

Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore,  using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of  corporate and personal authorship.. ",

Many of these have ceased publication; others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two  thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently released.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library must be at hand to carry out such a plan. "

Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study groups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library world.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate to his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo,  recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  The national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement. ",

The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been to tie it all together.   In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: European  civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to \"cover\" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an understanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all. Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.  "

The major question is whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and is not committed to any particular action program, community service or clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize, update and disseminate information.

Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward.

There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge, the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels. ",

Taking under consideration the study of \"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications.  There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them.  These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings.  The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year.  The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it. ",

In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship. The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary changes.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn on the schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore, \"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that may influence its direction.\" ",

It happens not unfrequently that some book is called for by a reader, or that in looking up the answer to a question a librarian has occasion to use a book  which he finds in the catalogue of another library, but which does not belong  to his own collection. The book, very likely, is one that can be replaced if lost.  But it would take time to get it through ordinary channels; it might  be necessary to send abroad for a copy or to wait to pick up one, if the book  is scarce.  In such a case it would be a great convenience to be able to borrow a book for a few days. ",

        "text": "   As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable  alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21 articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles.  She recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better known  members of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of The  Administration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\"  as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central  Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its  cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be  considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of  inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all users  of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:  1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?     Were you looking under author, title, or subject?  2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?  3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file?   One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were  questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a  separate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must  be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the  way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the  University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.

Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use  of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last  decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and  special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968  (Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).

Relatively  secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably obscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were preposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that  tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the  library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12 years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the experience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most  urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive. Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the  richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic  success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis. ",

The kindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make is that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country as we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thing that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three publishers of a library periodical to cease publication.   One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed  procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and  technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization within the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its  presence to the world at large.

        "text": "   A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today's requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates  are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries.   Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both. An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called \"Dust Gathers on the Public Library\" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is dead - while the public library lives on).

Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost  has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the  profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost  accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.   In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the  findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of  your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate  requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the  six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to  identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis,  these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful  for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.

Moreover, the necessity to combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of  self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer  afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone  is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only  as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his institution. ",

Although libraries got more of everything during those years, they still could not keep pace with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral programs, and the increasing production of books and journals.

Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

The nature of library materials best designed for this end required study in depth.  The findings and conclusions derived from the research project provide basic information about the adult new reader and his reading, criteria for analysis of reading materials, and a bibliography of materials.  These products of the study constitute a series of reading selection and guidance aids for use by all persons working in this area of service -- librarians, community workers, teachers, publishers, editors, and reading specialists.

It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed.     In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others.

This percentage falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered (1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more full-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even fewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian. Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform properly their functions of health education and patient care.   By \"community hospital\" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital providing general and selected special services, the hospital located at some distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research programs, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study of this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably newly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital's library and do not know where to begin.

This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of  cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards. It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created.   This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled \"Tasks for the future.\"  There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side.  In the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated, so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future, the immediate future at that. Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration.  The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field. ",

        "text": "   In spite of the great volume of material dealing with departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in library periodicals and books on university and college library administration, there has been relatively little original thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to provide an adequate background for solution of problems which have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against this type of library organization or statements of how this or that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no account of the conditions which brought about and for many years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.

Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The  processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have  become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!

Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual  in his original caste or class.  Much of the resulting mobility is based on a  radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists  anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills  of a high order.   Thus not only are individuals competing with one another in their efforts to rise in the class system, but occupations, too, are engaged in the same  competition and may move up or down in power, prestige, or income.

The greatest proportion of special library interrelationships are, on the surface at least, random and  informal.  We shall therefore concentrate on such arrangements as have about them some measure of structure and intent. Finally, we will deduce from these examples the performance and promise which special libraries may offer to a total library network or information  system. ",

This requires the use of decision rules which permit  library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest  returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society..    An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information, and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward  educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are  involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of  school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages  minority groups and governmental officials and staff..    Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are  forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies..

Three major classes of review articles were identified: (1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the  contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which  selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem, and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather  than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken.. The role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has  been on the order of 1:38.. Possible solutions to a number of problems associated with the review literature are discussed, such as the selection of articles for  review..Further examination of some critical questions relating to the production and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review, as a means of bringing the most significant information to its users, will be  accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications..

These models describe the amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book circulation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the  effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the  basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into  branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the  least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for duplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; for this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas.. ",

The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of catalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more than a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed  traffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000  interviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Information was derived on the catalog user's objective, starting clues, and university affiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed  on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches..  Reasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches.. Availability and accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained.. Published algorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated..  Attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized  catalogs.. Some of the available results are presented and discussed.. ",

        "text": "   It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered  libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for the testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect  research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in  helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most  instances) of the usefulness of such research for the improvement of their own organizations. Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices;  therefore, significant results can often be obtained with smaller samples and in shorter periods of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are  obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or  more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any  more convenient institution. ",

Thus, well-designed experiments should permit judging the relative merits of different classification schemes. This notion, although self-evident,  had remarkably little impact on the field of library science prior to the 1950's.  During that decade, the first controlled experiments on information retrieval were performed, and these mark a turning point in the history of classification research.  For the first time,  experimental procedure and the rules of scientific evidence became of critical  importance to indexing and classification. It is my purpose here to review some aspects of the most notable of these experimental tests - the ASLIB Cranfield Research Project. ",

He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began. ",

We also attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion. ",

While public and college libraries may have   several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.\tWeeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals.  These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries. ",

This is the beginning of an over-all automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr. Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were made.  Current (i.e",

        "text": "   As part of a design study to specify a regional processing center for the New England state university libraries, it was required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states were Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of collective reclassification.   The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections, showing, for example, that a random title from one library had  a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library. When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%. Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest duplication elsewhere. ",

        "text": "   When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second  thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an  avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not really summarize the findings of the study in one evening.   The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine libraries.

Over two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and  popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world, and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection. ",

A survey of libraries be conducted;     2. a survey of publishers be conducted;     3. an expert investigator be secured;     4. there must be adequate funding;     5. there be adequate space; and,     6. that those factors be eliminated which represented the most        crucial problem areas in the 1958-59 experiment.

In recent years there have been increasing demands from national  cataloging bodies and bibliographic agencies for uniformity in codes and  practices, and in consequence there has been more willingness to make national  concessions in order to reach international standards.. The IFLA Cataloging Secretariat was established in 1971 to assist this trend by co-ordinating work, promoting new projects and acting as a liaison center.. ",

The characteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of accomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of backlogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and the absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving  the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or  to leave it undone..

The second (A Metropolitan Library in Action, completed in 1939) proposed  quality, the achieving of recognized standards.  The underlying theme of the  present report is adaptability, the restructuring of the Library in a period  of change.    The first report, practical and pragmatic, achieved results.  The second,for  all its internal excellence, had limited effect.  It is hoped that the present effort partakes both of the relevance of the one and of the  integrity of the other. "

        "text": "         The measurement and evaluation of reference service has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the  literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized  literature of review.         Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with  other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an integral part of reference work because many reference librarians are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus  \"reference librarian\" does, how can one readily determine the effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a problem, but it is undeniably a big one. ",

Significant assessments will be made on the participating organization in research parts not only for the financing of day-to-day operations of facilities, especially set up for their benefit, but also for the total enrichment of the university library resources.

As a final paper, this solution for the storage of library materials will be discussed.  Although the distinct forms will not often be designated, \"microform\" is used here to mean the four forms most common in the United States: 35 mm. roll microfilm, microfiche (now standardized in the United States and Great Britain at 4 by 6 inches) and the two  micro-opaque forms - 3 by 5 inch Microcard, and 6 by 9 inch Microprint.

Results are, therefore, still meager and applications are still few.  Moreover, most of the work so far  reported has been limited to numerical analysis of the literature of the natural sciences.  This is in part because the secondary sources in the natural sciences are the best organized and so provide the most accessible data; in part because the literature of the natural sciences are the least restricted by linguistic barriers; and in part because the proposed world- wide systems, such as those advocated in the UNISIST report, offer an immediate field of application in the design of economic and efficient systems based on the results of numerical bibliographic analysis.  However, the field of possible application is gradually widening: serious efforts are now being made to organize the more diffused literatures of the social sciences, for example. ",

But, as Samuel Rothstein pointed out in his 1964 Library Trends article on the measurement and evaluation of reference service, much of the literature has focused on discussing the lack of evaluation or the shortcomings of the evaluation that has taken place.  In the ten years since Rothstein wrote his article, there does seem to be more effort at evaluation of reference service.  Undoubtedly, many of the trends in  recent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article. ",

One was the national sample survey of library use made for the Inquiry by the Survey Research Center of the  University of Michigan.  Personal interviews of a half-hour or more in length were held with 1,151 people selected at random in different counties scattered over the United States. The sample was designed so as to represent all adult persons living in private households.     By this tested method the survey gathered information  concerning the amount and the kind of use people make of the  public library and what changes or extension of library service people in general would prefer.  The survey also gathered information on the use of books obtained from sources other than the public library, as well as the extent of regular use of newspapers, radio, magazines, and movies. ",

The thought behind such a concept is to provide a separation of the more frequently used volumes from those that are infrequently used.  There have been, however, difficulties in determining what volumes are to be included within the core collection.  It is usually necessary to establish a committee or group of professional people who determine, usually by  enumeration, those volumes that should be included in the core collection. Often the results of such a determination merely reflect the opinions of the individuals, and although valid in many cases as desirable reading, the core collection that results may not be a reflection of user requirements.

        "text": "   The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries, apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department -- the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections, especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various  kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach. Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer, orientalist or linguist.    The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments. ",

That is, these two, and only these two, commonly collect over a very broad spectrum, and in depth, material which makes possible the creation of new knowledge.   Herein lies the paramount importance of these libraries to society if it be granted, as it is here assumed, that almost no field of human endeavor can advance without resort to the recorded past.  It is this twin aspect of the activity of these scholarly libraries - collecting simultaneously in breadth and in depth - which produces most of their major problems.  The concern of this paper is with two of these problems which seem by far the most important and difficult: the selection of materials and the utilization of subject specialists. ",

Production of monographs and journals, research reports and government documents has been increasing exponentially to the point that British university librarians are beginning to feel the sense of constriction of space which their American counterparts have been struggling with for a number of years (judging by the amount of print devoted to the subject in American library journals).  The force of this sense of constriction has been somewhat mitigated in all but the copyright libraries by the general lack of funds available for book purchasing, and by the increasing price of books.  However, when space in the library does become filled, obviously something must be done to create more space, because the flow of material is certainly not going to cease. "

This first paper outlines the origins of PRECIS, and considers its use in English- Language indexing.  A second paper will deal in general terms with the syntactical model which is used for producing PRECIS input strings and index entries.  Later papers will then review the application of this model to indexing in, firstly, the Germanic languages (e.g. German and Danish), and, secondly, the Romance languages, illustrated by French. ",

A series of early meetings of The Club of Rome culminated in the decision to initiate a remarkably ambitious undertaking - the Project on the Predicament of Mankind.     The intent of the project is to examine the complex of problems troubling men of all nations: poverty in the midst of plenty; degradation of the environment; loss of faith in institutions; uncontrolled urban spread; insecurity of employment; alienation of youth; rejection of traditional values; and inflation and other monetary and economic disruptions.

The ordinary way of doing this would be either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the various styles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between men and science.  Previous lecturers in this series have given accounts of the content of space science and made excursions into the philosophy and the history of science.  Although professionally my concern is with the history of science, I have a certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has led me to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinary way.   My goal is not discussion of the content of science or even a humanistic analysis of its relations.  Rather, I want to clarify these more usual approaches by treating separately all the scientific analyses that may be made of science.  Why should we not turn the tools of science on science itself?  Why not measure and generalize, make hypotheses, and derive conclusions? ",

Among the first problems we confronted were those of measurement. In the fall of 1965 the first pretest of value-scale items was under way. The goal of the pretest was to develop valid and reliable scales of values in four national samples.   The second problem we had to face arose from the nees to obtain \"comparable\" measures of community \"activeness\" in four countries. ",

This aim was never realized, because it soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked with, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which it was situated.  The wider study which then appeared necessary was not practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively, assuming its present significance only in the context of later studies. ",

The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's \"purposeful state\": specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action.   The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message.  The amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives.\tThe amounts of instruction and  motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.   The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of motivation in the state.  This concept can be generalized to express the value of the state to some other individual. ",

To overcome these assumptions and the deficiencies which result from them, a management information system should be imbedded in a management control system.

This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings.

A suitability rating system, based on these criteria, is used by the author to rate twenty-six management science models for their suitability of use in R&D project selection decision making.  Profitability index and scoring types of models were found to have generally higher ease of use and lower cost performances than the other types. The linear and nonlinear models had generally higher flexibility, while the linear, nonlinear and zero-one models had generally higher realism than the other model types. ",

It puts various methods of managing problems into a framework where the leader can identify, study and change his own behavior.  Thus he is in a position to understand it better, to evaluate the results it produces, and to encourage its use by others.    ",

The library community, both here and abroad, has accepted MARC and recognizes its potential for the future.  The single most significant result of MARC has been the impetus to set standards.  There is no doubt that eventually standards would have been designed for machine-readable bibliographic records, character sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC accelerated standardization and still more important, the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community. The cooperation among the producers and users of bibliographic description has been a rewarding experience. ",

The computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful tools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities.   Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern  recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems:  biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics, archaeology, sociology, etc.  But more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science.  Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy.  The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified.

In some connections it may be desirable to use a still broader definition of communication, namely, one which would include the procedures by means of which one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track an airplane and to compute its probably future positions) affects another mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane).   The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer to the special, but still very broad and important, field of the  communication of speech; but practically everything said applies equally as well to music of any sort, and to still or moving pictures, as in television.

One thinks immediately of the basic work of Zipf and Skinner, of the developments in information theory, in concept formation, in second language learning, in work association research, and generally of the increasing integration of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the activities of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology.  Almost every new issue of a social science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity. A significant aspect of much of this development has been the  devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques. During the past six or seven years, a group of us at the University of Illinois has been concentrating on the development of an objective measure of meaning, and this book is largely a progress report of that research.

        "text": "     The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction.     Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present  rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction. ",

It is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library service.  It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service.         Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants, boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems.  This handbook is intended for these groups, and especially for practicing librarians.  The pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions, however, leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups. ",

But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse! - constitutes important knowledge of man.

Meanwhile, however, a closely similar treatment of the problem of how to buy library materials, long in process, suddenly shaped up and was published by ALA in November 1969.  This was Purchasing Library Materials in Public and School Libraries by Evelyn Hensel and Peter D. Veilette.     A treatment of the acquisition process in college and university libraries was also taking shape at this time and became the January 1970 issue of Library Trends.  The acquisition problems of research libraries were likewise getting detailed examination in the two annual International Seminars on Approval and Gathering Plans in Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, sponsored by Western Michigan University in the fall of 1968 and the fall of 1969.

The survey was designated to discover the subject, date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the most frequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of references to biomedical publications.   The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issues involved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand was less than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requests were for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biological literature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8 per cent) involved English language periodicals.   Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literature were citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recent literature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primary sources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the most used indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents. "

A growing number of published studies indicate that improper production, inadequate bibliographic access, lack of  standardization, defects in equipment design, maintenance problems, poor environments for microform usage, and certain inherent characteristics of the microforms themselves all combine to make their use inconvenient. Solutions to most of these problems have existed for some time, but the microform industry has been slow to correct them.  Some positive developments have occurred in the last two years, but the major problems remain.  ",

Other kinds of status-judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers), critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for that performance.

It argues that such social variables as the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities or disciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explain phage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecular biology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position, adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergence of experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology and philosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities which occur in scientific development.

Therefore the book has three foci:  organizational goals; organizational structure; and organizations and their social environment.  Considerably more space is devoted to organizational structure than to the other topics, for two reasons:  First, more research has been conducted and more writings are available on organizational structure than on organizational goals (Chapter 2) and  environment.  Second, the major schools of organizational analysis have fixed their interests on structural aspects of the organization, and thus, we may best evaluate these different approaches in the context of organizational structure.

It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in  recent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simple textbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable  developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is  well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also, in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible to construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions (of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly) is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, they are easier to construct. ",

It is an important study, since the analyses and interpretations of the authors suggest that a breakthrough may well have been made to provide new insights into the nature and method of operation of job attitudes.   The senior authors were well prepared for their task, having recently completed a comprehensive review and analysis of the research in this field, reported in Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion.  This review of several thousand articles and books regarding the factors relating to job attitudes and the effect of job attitudes on work performance indicated much disagreement and confusion in the field.  It appeared that one of the major contributors to this apparent diversity of results was the unstable nature of the subjective data on which studies in this field have been typically based. ",

The program supports the construction of a thesaurus and its use.  The relational system corresponds to ISO/DIS 2788 (UNESCO) and DIN 1463.  It differentiates, however, in addition generically related and contiguous terms pertaining to a part-whole system. Characteristics that determine narrower terms against their broader terms are introduced as new relation.  Many types of associations are made available for experimenting.  The programmed generation of dependent relations reduces the amount of work to one third although ensuring total avoidance of formal errors and logical contradictions, even in applying permitted polyhierarchy.  The program is available in batch mode or in an interactive timesharing version (Remote GENTHES).  The program functions are input, logical and formal input checking, generation of relations, display, delete, print on line printer and storage on disk.  GENTHES is running in Vienna on a System IBM/370. ",

        "text": "   For a number of reasons mentioned it is proposed to reorganize in a new edition the existing UDC completely, to reallocate the subject fields of the UDC main classes according to present day views, state of knowledge and priorities, and to subdivide these main classes only by subfields of subject fields.  The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniform array of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the technique of interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories: (1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization, (7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation. ((5) is left free for the  moment).  Proposals for further simplification of the scheme are outlined regarding the general categories, the symbols used and the rules for  syntagmatic organization taking into account the implications of computer technology.  Possible changes in the layout and editions of a new UDC are discussed. ",

        "text": "   Concurrently with the RECON Pilot Project, the RECON working Task Force  undertook to consider certain basic questions of retrospect conversation that are of national scope.   First, is it feasible to define a level or subset of the MARC format that  would allow a library using the lower level to be part of a future national network?   Second, is it possible to use machine-readable records from a variety of  sources in a national bibliographic store as a way to reduce the conversion effort on the national level?   Third, what are the problems of producing a National Union Catalog from  machine-readable records?   As these studies and the pilot project progressed, it also became apparent  that there were many practical difficulties in carrying out a large-scale  conversion project.  Therefore, it seemed essential to investigate alternative  strategies for RECON that might yield broad benefits in a reasonable short  time span. ",

The emphasis of the study as stated by  COSATI is as follows:     1. Initial and primary priority will be placed on national systems  relating to scientific and technical documents, their handling and the management of such documents.  Specific matters to be reported on will include,  the current organizational and functional situation in the United States; the  extent to which known  deficiencies are causing a reduction in the  potential  for technical effectiveness in the United States scientific and technical  community; the alternatives which are available and economically feasible for  correction of these deficiencies; and one or more action plans which can be followed by governmental (especially including Congress) and non-governmental  units.     2. Secondary attention will be given to development of programs which can  be undertaken with Government support for identifying,  analyzing, and giving  a structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in the  United States.\" ",

It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the  transmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, the  transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the transmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process. An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the development of such a process. "

        "author": " Goffman, W. ",
        "text": "   One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature  of its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at  one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their  particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance to  scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right.   Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread  within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can  therefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set of  mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of  scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to  establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area  of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the  given area.   The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensive  survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\"  in which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\"  This bibliography  constitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread of  scientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to the  subject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963.

        "text": " Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision,  in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet very  little experimental evidence on the consistency of either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor  is reasonably constant.  But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in  the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in  the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year,  only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rank  correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.   There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is no mention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from the  earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which  analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in  terms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations  to that article.  Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is often  intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of  which he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between  the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers. ",

        "text": "   Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases.   We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.   We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered \"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation.

The analysis has shown that the existing criteria for evaluation of special bibliographies (scope, coverage, arrangement, speed of announcement, etc.) are inadequate for an unbiased characterization of their exhaustivity and subject contents..  This hampers a correct choice of the sources of secondary  information and leads to duplication, parallelisms and loss of information.. Judgements of the leading Soviet and foreign bibliographers relating to the problems under consideration are reviewed, which are all essentially in favor  of a reconstruction of the publishing processes, issuing of scientific  publications on a world scale, and algorithmization of the information processes..  It is suggested that the first objective of research should be a method of comparative evaluation of periodicals.. ",

General rules are given for  lexicographic processing of the keywords accumulated and for compiling of the descriptor vocabulary.. The algorithm has been constructed which is designed  to generate the article of each descriptor in the thesaurus.. To construct this algorithm the author analyzed the results of word-association tests and  selected 5 most important types of paradigmatic relations.. He formulates the  basic rules for translation of the texts describing the main subject content of the documents and of the users' requests from a natural language into the IR language of descriptors..

Research  Institute aimed towards creating a descriptor language for an information retrieval system in the field of chemistry and chemical engineering.. The objectives of an optimum reduction of retrieval noise and maximum recall have  required the introduction of grammatical and transformational devices into the language.. The former condition is provided for by a matrix notation of  document search patterns and requests, while the latter condition is met with the help of the transformational devices of the language..    Examples of search requests and patterns are considered, which illustrate the \"resolution\" of the grammatical and transformational devices being  developed.. These are said largely to eliminate subjectiveness in assigning relational factors in search patterns and requests..    The relevancy criterion is formulated.. A retrieval algorithm based on this criterion has been compiled..    Experimental searches were conducted on a Minsk-22 computer.. The results  were analyzed to evaluate the grammatical and transformational devices and to verify indexing principles devised for the automated retrieval system under development..    Factors of \"silence\" are discussed, as well as the contribution of the  grammatical and transformational devices to reducing noise and enhancing  recall.. ",

        "author": " Shemakin, Yu. I. ",
        "text": "    The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..    The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed  content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval  language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document..    Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given..    Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been  corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be    based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing..

Consideration is first given to indexes compiled by or with the aid of machines, including citation indexes.  Automatic derivative indexing is exemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word- in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, and possibilities for modification and improvement are discussed. Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized. Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classification and categorization, computer use of thesauri, statistical association techniques, and linguistic data processing are described.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularly in view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.  It is concluded that indexes based on words extracted from text are practical for many purposes today, and that automatic assignment indexing and classification experiments show promise for future progress.

We conclude that the British CAB pattern, while creative, richly implicative and a major source of valuable guidance, if merely duplicated would not make the optimum contribution to the current American scene.   We find overwhelming evidence that new information, advice, referral provision are necessary.  Localities need and want Neighborhood Information Centers (NIC's).   We find promising beginnings and a number of attractive possibilities emerging out of the somewhat different efforts by a number of federal agencies, local government and local voluntary groups.  However, no one of these provides auspices for all the needed functions in accord with qualities which we find to be essential. ",

        "cross_references": "   In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and  infrequently used by physicians.  The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist.   Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library.   Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and  fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was also requested that recommendations be made in order of preference. "

This volume departed from the accustomed cheering.  It is my impression that the adult reader was always more skeptical than the economists of the neo-Keynesian nirvana.  Economic life was not meant to be that easy.  And perhaps some sensed what I here urge, that what was called success was less what served the individual than what served the goals of great industrial and military bureaucracies which had come, the economic myth notwithstanding, to comprise so large a part of the economic system.  Still, who could tell that a herald of such news would be welcomed - or even heard.  ",

Central to the study rationale was the notion that librarianship should be viewed not as a static institution committed solely to traditional objectives, but as one with the capacity to be responsive to changing environmental requirements. It was hoped that from the intelligence gathered from these inquiries certain of the significant dimensions of the field's manpower concerns would be illuminated and proposals to influence future development would be drawn.  Thus, while the investigations were in the nature of more basic research, their ends were committedly pragmatic. ",

It draws also upon research done in voluntary organizations.   To maintain a relatively consistent orientation, the focus of this volume is largely on the problems of business enterprises.

The first systematic attempt to assess the size of this problem, carried out by the Aslib Research Department, suggests the actual figure is more than double this, and  the consequent cost to the nation to be measurable in millions of pounds.   We put questions to 647 scientists engaged in industrial, academic or  government research, including chemists, physicists, biologists, psychologists and mathematicians.  One question was: \"Have you, during your current research, discovered in the literature information which you wish you had had at the  beginning of your project?\"  To this, 144 of them (22 per cent) replied that they had.  Many had made more than one such find, so that the total number of  instances was 245. ",

        "text": "    Syntagmatic relations (SR) are defined as connections between words that are established aposteriori and combine these words into phrases and sentences.. The lack of means for recording SR in descriptor languages results in a  reduction of retrieval precision.. At present, roles and links and the  evaluation of the extent to which these devices are used are the major devices used for the description of SR between descriptors in documents' search  patterns.. An analysis of published results of experiments testing the  performance of roles and links in 176 descriptor retrieval systems operative in the USA suggests the conclusion about a poor performance of roles as a  precision device:  an increase of 10 percent in precision with the aid of roles is accompanied by a 10 percent reduction of recall.. Links provide for  approximately the same increase of precision.. The author states the general requirements to a simple and flexible grammar for descriptor languages, and show that the approach the suggest ts has been partially implemented in the information retrieval language for radioelectronics and computer technology developed at the Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Kiev, and in the SYNTOL (France)..

Bradford, discussed certain regularities in the pattern of distribution of articles on  a particular subject over different journals.  He gives as examples the distributions for geophysics from 1928-31 inclusive and lubrication for 1931 to June, 1933, inclusive.  The typical picture is one in which, to a bibliography covering a certain short term of years, a few journals contribute a large number of articles, more journals contribute fewer and so on in a monotonic sequence ending with a large number of journals contributing one article each.  Patterns of this kind have been observed by several authors, but Bradford was the first, I think, to advance an explanation of the effect in bibliographical terms. ",

The rapid expansion of collections, both in size and scope, the great variety of forms taken by items that now must be housed in the library, and the growth in expectations among library users are among the factors that have contributed to this complexity.  In this setting, managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficult  task. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer great opportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult the  use of traditional, intuitive approaches.  It is reasonable to ask whether  techniques such as Operations Research (O. R.) that have proved valuable in  similar situations for business and government, might not also be of service  in libraries.  ",

The area presented by n+1 distinct shelf heights is minimized for any collection that can be  characterized by an item-height distribution.. When item-height is continuous, the necessary conditions for the extremum are recursive in the optimal shelf heights, and the solution reduces to a simple computational search.. For  certain distribution functions, as demonstrated in the example, an additional recursive relation between the solutions for different n further simplified  the computation considerable.. Geometrical representations of both the model and  the solution method are presented.. The maximum increase in storage capacity  can be expressed generally as a simple function of the mean and the maximum item-height.. "

This is the central  question which this book addresses.. Such a question is quite different from the central theme of most earlier organizational studies, which have tended to focus on the question of what is the one best way to organize, irrespective of the external environmental conditions facing the business.. In this  important respect this study breaks new ground.. Nevertheless, it draws heavily on earlier studies in the field of organization behavior at Harvard Business School and elsewhere, as well as the related literature of the  behavioral sciences.. The authors not only report the findings of a comparative study of ten organizations with different levels of economic performance in  three distinct industrial environments, but also use these findings to unravel some of the apparent contradictions in current organization theory.. A  discussion of the implications of these findings for the design and  administration of large organizations in relation to their specific market and technological environments is also included.. "

        "text": "     This book is about the theory of formal organizations.  It is easier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizations than to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formal organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York State Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of a larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn around an organization or the exact distinction between an \"organization\" and a \"nonorganization.\"  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean classifications.     Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have  been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, \"industrial social psychology\" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter on formal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughout the text. ",

I assume merely that the concepts relevant to important relationships exist, and once having identified some, I hope to generate potentially significant propositions.  We lack the systematic evidence that eventually must come, but there are illustrative studies cited to indicate that the propositions which are neither time- nor space-bound.     I assume that there are differences among organizations, and hope to account for some of them.  But I also assume that there is not a one- to-one correspondence between significant organizational differences and the typical categories of business, government, medicine, and education. Likewise, I believe there is not a direct correlation between the academic disciplines and useful categories of complex organizations. ",

I hope that the book will be of value to British and overseas librarians as a case study of the development of a national library, and also to students of librarianship and information work in that it may help them to appreciate the context in which the library has evolved and in which it now operates.

Research on file organization has concentrated on retrieval of  multiple entries possessing some equal or similar characteristic.  However, a basic library bibliographic file should be organized to yield a record unequal and dissimilar to all others.  Such a file is analogous to the familiar main entry catalog, which every library maintains, and would have associated with it supplementary index files of subjects, titles, call numbers, and perhaps  other attributes.

Consequently, epidemic theory can be applied to the study of any process in which information is transmitted within a population..  The members of such populations need not be human beings but could be micro-organisms or even machines.. The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A  mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established  and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process  and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions  for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations which represent the process.. ",

The most prominent domain-independent theory is classification theory, the subject of Part I of this book.  Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors.   Attempts to find domain-independent procedures for constructing these vector representations have not yielded generally useful results.  Instead, every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to its special characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domain has received by far the most attention.  Furthermore, work in this area has progressed from picture classification to picture analysis and description. Part II of this book is devoted to a systematic presentation of these topics in visual scene analysis. ",

Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower.   It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought.

Three aspects of the problem deserve more careful treatment than they have received.  These are: the effects of automation and electronics on planning; the overall organization of service patterns; and, the relevance of other audiovisual learning media.   This is a book about the planning process, not the details of all parts of a building.  It will not tell you which floor covering is best, which light fixtures to use or which kind of library shelving to buy.  These matters are treated in detail by Metcalf.  It will, however, try to tell you how to go about solving these and the many other problems planners face.   Wherever it seems relevant and proper, I have included  sketches to illustrate the point under discussion.  For the simplicity of these illustrations, I beg the indulgence of the reader. ",

In order to discover how to get the Image into motion, therefore, we reviewed once more the cybernetic literature on the analogies between brains and computers, between minds and programs.     Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology.  The men who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent about psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to simulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than like living animals.  But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to  believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or  even an advantage.  There must be some way to phrase the new ideas so  that they can contribute to and profit from the science of behavior  that psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorable  intersection that directed the course of our year-long debate. "

        "title": " PRECIS:  a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing ",
        "author": " Austin, D. ",
        "text": "   In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971.   To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers;  secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.   In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal of Cutter's \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of  identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document.

        "text": "         Since the first edition of Library of Congress subject headings appeared 60 years ago, American and other libraries have increasingly relied on this list as the chief authority -- if not the sole basis -- for subject cataloging.  There can be no quarrel about the practical necessity for such a labor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about its value as a global standardizing agent, a means for achieving some uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic. Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as to ordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headings in subject catalogs as far removed geographically as Washington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarship are, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally, manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed and subsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of the worldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realm of headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, with humanity--the LC list can only \"satisfy\" parochial, jingoistic Europeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominally Christian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortably situated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largely domiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the Established Order, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory of  Western civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed,  obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to young people and women.  And exudes something less than sympathy or even fairness toward organized labor and the sexually unorthodox or \"avant-garde.\" ",

The broad topic coverage also should make the text helpful for students who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for  practitioners who desire an up-to-date review of operations research.  The book can be used in half-year or full-year introductory courses for juniors, seniors, or graduates in business, economics, and engineering curricula.   The central goal of the book is to answer the question, \"What are the fundamental ideas of operations research?\"  The text does not presuppose any advanced training in business administration, industrial engineering, mathematics, statistics, probability theory, or economics.  Therefore, the main ideas do not rely on the reader's being expert in these areas.  The text does assume, however, that the reader is not entirely naive about such subjects. ",

        "text": "    At Birmingham University Library it is proposed to implement in October  l972, a complete microfilm catalogue system.. This system originated from two  sources.. Over the past two years various means have been evaluated of converting the library's card catalogues (which were closed at the end of 1971) to a more compact form.. An interim report mentioned microfilming as one of a  number of possibilities.. At the time the production of hard copy was  envisaged, but since then a true microform system has seemed preferable, in  which the catalogue would exist as cassettes of film to be viewed by all users on reader machines.. This system has been specified and costed, and details are included in this paper.. The impetus in reaching this viewpoint was provided by the progress made over the last 18 months in the field of COM, which rapidly commended itself as the choice of output medium for the new mechanized  MARC-based catalogue, which covers all the library's serials and all  monographs acquired after January 1972.. BLCMP union catalogues in these categories will also be held in COM form at Birmingham University Library.. ",

        "text": "    The technical and economic feasibility of providing selective notifications of current books to specialized libraries by extraction from MARC tapes has  been explored.. An experimental on-line system 'MARCAS' was used to test profile  construction and the utility of the various elements in MARC records as search keys.. The programs allowed both weighted and Boolean searching on the title   and author, LC classification and subject headings, and the BNB Precis indexing terms and Reference Index Numbers.. Test profiles were constructed for nine libraries covering a range of subject fields, and run on six weeks of BNB and  six weeks of LC MARC tapes.. The output was assessed for relevance and recall, and the results analyzed in terms of precision and recall for various  combinations of searchable fields.. The best performance, with recall and precision both about 50%, was given by searching all verbal fields together -  title and author, LC subject headings, and (BNB tapes only) Precis indexing  terms.. Costs for the experimental on-line system, and a batch version of the system, are identified.. ",

An International Conference of Libraries and Documentation Centres was held in Brussels from 11 to 18 September 1955.  During the Conference, a whole forenoon was devoted to a Group Meeting on \"Classification, General and Special\", under my Chairmanship.  The following two resolutions recommended by the Group Meeting were adopted by the Plenary Meeting on 16 September 1955.   \"1 The FID recommends that a deeper and more extensive study  should be made of the general theory of classification, including facet analysis, and also of their application in the documentation of specific subjects.   \"2 The Commission proposes, that in liaison with the FID/CA Committee, a permanent Working Group be created in order to make mutual exchange of theoreticians' experiences and points of view possible.  The rapporteurs shall bring about the creation of such a group and furnish the information and means of work in order that practical results may be obtained in the shortest time, by making mail exchanges easier and more frequent.  The scheme proposed by Dr. Ranganathan will serve as the basic document\" [154].  Further, at its meeting held on 16 September 1955, the Council of FID requested its Bureau to convene an International Seminar on Classification. This was in accord with the memorandum prepared by me at the request of Donker Duyvis [133]. ",

The persistence with which this number plagues me is far more than a random accident.  There is, to quote a famous senator, a design behind it, some pattern governing its appearances.

In just what sense  distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete.. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis.. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to  compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit.. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper.. ",

In this book, the definition of a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of independent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member libraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The most pertinent of the repeated questions was, \"How does system membership change local library administration?\"  The sharpest question was, \"Will the system ultimately take over local rights and responsibilities?\"  "

Since ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, have passed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility, in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow, however sketchily, developments in both America and Britain, and to note with some care what was happening in scholarly libraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, and in libraries intended for the working classes.

Studies of librarians' academic backgrounds have indicated a preponderance of humanities and social science majors in the field.  Too often librarians have had only a few courses in mathematics, and some actually have a psychological antipathy toward numbers.  This anti-mathematics syndrome has kept librarians from taking proper advantage of quantitative methods. ",

All too many librarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents of international agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials in format and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions, control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to the specialist in documents.  The result is that international documents are a puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the ill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of a general course in government documents to which relatively few students are exposed.  The information in this volume will allay the fears of the generalist librarian.  It also provides the data on which to base additional emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum. ",

Another currently used term is 'library instruction', which puts the emphasis on  the library rather than the reader, and which also suggests to some that library instruction concerns the training of librarians. For the purpose of this introductory handbook 'reader instruction' is taken to mean instruction given to readers to help them make  the best use of a library, particularly an academic library of some size and complexity.

This is not a book, to state the  proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers.   The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer.   The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust developments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished.   The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by Richard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this  article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section.   News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage.   The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs.   The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably  represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings.   The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable. ",

This book is intended to present the flavor and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it gives a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health science organizations, so much the better.   If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is so no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine as practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into the health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of others, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research, education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health. Increasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream of medicine. ",

Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar.   Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.

The first step of the method proposed is to type the card data on a perforated tape typewriter in a way which identifies all of the items on the card.. After the data is edited and corrected, it is processed by a computer to form (1) catalog card typesetting tapes, (2) the National Union Catalog, (3) Library of Congress Books, Subjects Catalog, magnetic tape catalog files, and a master magnetic or perforated paper tape record copy for distribution.. The procedure also allows the recording of data which does not now appear on Library of Congress cards, should studies find that the value of the data exceeds the cost of recording it..    A demonstration was performed in which cards were typed to produce  perforated tape records.. These record tapes were automatically converted to a variety of output forms ranging from phototypeset catalog cards and book catalog entries to tape typewriter and line printer produced catalog cards..

While it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library  buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of long range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of \"selective book retirement\"'.  Library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy, time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services  for readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review \"Weeding the Collection\" put forward the view that \"a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary... He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden\".  The Pebul Report summarised the position in a remarkably appropriate metaphor when it observed that \"weeding the bookstock\" in academic libraries was the \"ungrasped nettle.\" "

The major portion of the two years spent on this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance, but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of non-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within the present work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the  continuation of the project. "

The results of surveys aimed at ascertaining the needs or demands of users of the physics literature are considered,  particularly where these reveal weakness in the present organization of information transfer, and the reactions of users to new services intended to remedy the deficiencies..

The two aspects of a structural notation most determinative here are hierarchicality and uniform use of general categories (the latter, not merely for the sake of uniformity as such, but as the means to a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata could of course be present on the \"idea plane\" alone; but without their being present notationally they do not furnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the type of assistance it requires for optimal functioning.   The second (minor) premise ought to be that the Universal Decimal Classification, being both hierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desired structurality.  But the melancholy fact is that this desideratum is not always satisfied, for instance when UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy when division by general category would be equally appropriate. ",

It thus comparizes simple and \"fused\" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused),  or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are  disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds).  The word \"system\" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both.   Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted after the reference. ",

There is an urgency associated with this rededication, which grows in direct proportion to the increase in the funding and planning of anthropological research and especially to the role anthropologists have been asked to assume in the planning and carrying out of international development programs.  A general theory of history is required if the  expansion of disposable research funds is to result in something other than the rapid growth in the amount of trivia being published in the learned journals.  The publishing of more and more about less and less is an  acceptable consequence of affluence only if specialization does not lead to an actual neglect or even obfuscation of fundamental issues. ",

Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress.  To avoid the constant repetition of such phrases as \"the full catalog of a large library\" and \"a concise finding-list,\" I shall use the three words Short, Medium, and Full as proper names, with the preliminary caution that the Short family are not all the same size, that there is more than one Medium, and that Full may be Fuller and Fullest.  Short, if single-columned, is generally a title-a-liner; if printed in double columns, it allows the title  occasionally to exceed one line, but not, if possible, two; Medium does not limit itself in this way, but it seldom exceeds four lines, and gets many titles into a single line.  Full usually fills three or four lines and often takes six or seven for a title. "

Kuhn.  Kuhn has not been accepted without criticism, but that need not prevent us from using his book as a point of departure for discussion.  I assume that the reader will be familiar with Kuhn's analysis,so that only a sketchy summary of his position is necessary.  I will then take a brief look at some of the history of psychology, with special emphasis upon the major tenets of behaviorism.  Finally, I will advance some evidence to suggest that we may well be living in an era of revolution within psychology (as well as without). ",

The thesis which Palermo advocated is that Kuhn's view of scientific revolution is applicable to the recent history of experimental psychology, and that, in particular, experimental psychology has had two paradigms already, with the appropriate scientific revolution between them, and that the current behavioristic paradigm may well be in a state of Kuhnian crisis.  The present note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's  assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a standard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first, challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a Kuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorism is in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for this.

        "text": "   Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science.  For example, there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age.  These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future. Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline. We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a  statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the  appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified?

The work developed directly from an earlier paper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other citation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science.

On the other hand, many of the large universities have shifted the emphasis from undergraduate work to graduate study. Still others have tried to develop both side by side. Few of the small colleges have kept astride with the inevitable consequences of such a situation.  The few who have are sending an increasing number of their graduates to these universities to complete their training.  As an example of this, it is the boast of Pomona College that over seventy per cent of her graduates have taken subsequent professional training. It has become the evident duty, therefore, of the small college to prepare its men, not only to enter such graduate schools, but also to meet successfully the ever-increasing intensity of competition found there.  This in addition to supplying a broad cultural education.  This duty has brought with it a number of problems of first magnitude.  One of the biggest of these is the problem of adequate library facilities.   It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this problem with special reference to the student whose college major is chemistry. ",

In Table I are listed these source journals, together with the total number of pages of the actual articles studied, the total number of citations in each journal, the number of references to books and to personal communications, and the net total, which represents the citations to serial literature.  It is these last mentioned references which will be considered in further detail.  The totals are probably slightly high, due to unintentional counting in single articles of repetitions of the same citation. ",

        "text": "  In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an  inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of  antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough  scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they  could be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable.   Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing  the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it.   This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a  new approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue of  its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would  never be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as an  association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading. ",

        "text": "   Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year (measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800 to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percent per year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If the total number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating from the curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titles grows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two \"pauses\" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponential growth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate less than half that found by Price and other investigators.\tThe discrepancy appears to be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account the titles published before the beginnings of the time series used.

It also invites a variety of statistical investigations, which must, however, be considered with prudence, since they may lead to misleading results.  No matter how cautiously the authors express themselves, the casual readers,  that is the majority, will treat  the results as established facts and forget about the assumptions underlying them.  This is also happening with the computer output for economic models, which is accepted as if it were experimental observation. "

Gradually the study began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research, publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions, unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else enmeshed in rapid change.   This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a choice - and so have we all. "

        "text": "   A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or  telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.   From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The  thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics. ",

Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judge by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among psychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.

        "text": " For Popper, science is the very epitome of objective knowledge.  The central papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says:   All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective knowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objective knowledge as masons work on a cathedral.   I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'. This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third, I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is seriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transforming Popper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformative method' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makes knowledge objective. ",

A second purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and other advanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature of the life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons in management positions of organizations in which the establishment of a library is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents, the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource for library consultants engaged in assisting management to make the right decisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessed and endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements. ",

This book is one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a  scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike many previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide range of research personnel.   Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of laboratories. ",

At least a dozen different program packages, collections, or systems (not to mention hundreds of individual programs) have emerged by now and are in use by social scientists at universities and research centers all across the country.  It is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working at one institution, often operating under a relatively restricted set of research and computing assumptions.  This parochial tendency has left students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time- consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data each time they change institutions (or each time the institution changes computers).

It used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science.

In a careful analysis of the existing literature, the authors marshal an imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesis that social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of the process of industrialization.

In a rough ecological series, we find on one end the forest dwelling West African Species (Mandrillus leucophaneus, M. sphinx, Papio papio), none of which has so far been studied in the field.  The first step into open country is realized by the savanna baboons of South and East Africa, including, from south to north, the species Papio ursinus, cynocephalus and anubis.  Their social organization and its ecological context have been subject to long range field work by HALL (1962 a, b) in South Africa, by DEVORE (1962) in Kenya, and by ALTMANN and ALTMANN (in preparation) in Kenya ad Tanzania. In both regions, the groups can range far into the open grassland, but at night, they withdraw to high trees or, as in the Cape region, to vertical cliffs. ",

The interdependent behavior of many people in their supportive and complementary actions takes on a form or structure which needs to be conceptualized at a more appropriate collective level.  Classical organization theory we found unsatisfactory because of its implicit assumptions about the closed character of social structures.  The development of open-system theory, on the other hand, furnished a much more dynamic and adequate framework.  Hence, our effort, in the pages that follow, is directed at the utilization of an open-system point of view for the study of large-scale organizations.    ",

Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).  Who published what and where therefore becomes a central  question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications.  This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline. ",

In the following, I shall limit myself to four broad areas of inquiry which have been so arranged that my own further reflections figure rather prominently though by no means exclusively in the first two sections while the latter two are more heavily weighted with reports and comments on the research and contributions  of others.

        "text": "   In recent years social scientists have given increased attention to problems of inequality, justice, and discrimination in American society. The influence of ascribed statuses on the life chances of individuals is being studied in an effort to estimate the \"fairness\" of social institutions in rewarding talent.  Social scientists are trying to determine the extent to which so-called \"irrelevant\" characteristics influence the ways in which people are judged by social institutions and eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income, prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society, science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Little is known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This book examines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment? A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whether universalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis for recognition in the social system of science. ",

I have tried to indicate its possible broader relevance by pointing out certain basic parallels between the \"social system\" of science and other social systems within society.  I hope, further, that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions I have drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seems now to exist between those sociologists who are concerned with society as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms of its consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists who are concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goals of the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior. My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that most individuals, most of the time, come to \"want\" to do what it is that society \"needs\" them to do.  Only when we can answer this question satisfactorily, can we develop a sociology capable of  providing both prediction and meaning. "

        "text": "   Of the four chapters, added to this edition, two come from published symposia,one of which is out of print and the other of which, I am told, is nearing that same state of exhaustion.   This chapter sets forth the concept of 'the influential,' identifies two distinctive types of influentials, the 'local' and the 'cosmopolitan,' and relates these types to the structure of influence in the local community.   The second of these chapters, \"Contributions to the Theory of Reference Group Behavior,\" draws upon the ample evidence provided by The American Soldier to formulate certain conditions under which people orient themselves to the norms of various groups, in particular the groups with which they are not affiliated.   The other two chapters added to this edition have not been published before.  The first of these, \"Continuities in the Theory of Social Structure and Anomie,\" tries to consolidate recent empirical and theoretical analyses of the sources and consequences of that breakdown of social norms which is described as anomie.  The second, \"Continuities in the Theory of Reference Groups and Social Structure,\" tries to bring out some of the specially sociological, as distinct from the socio-psychological, implications of current inquiries into reference-group behavior.  The intent is to examine some of the theoretical problems of social structure which must be solved before certain further advances can be made in the sociological analysis of reference groups.  ",

        "text": "     By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science, the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance  and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for  the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is a means of exercising social control.     The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system.

Research  networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase  is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration, made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence..  But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish..  Consequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the network, together with the movement of participants to new areas of  scientific opportunity.. ",

        "text": "    A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of  scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of  the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history..    This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data  indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the  physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the  research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested.. ",

The analysis  mostly uses multivariate linear regression.. Large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the  variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied.. It is shown that prestige is correlated with average amount of informal scientific communication and with departmental morale even after possible confounding variables are held constant.. ",

The principal goal of the book is to bring to the attention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists, the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of biology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the applied areas of technology to which they are essential.

Graduate students who qualify for positions as professional librarians have to learn about this vast preserve, and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of this book.   The task of this book is to place in the reader's hands a sort of chart and compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system works.   For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist, sought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographical review of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material. This review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informative annotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained by the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplify types of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes to works which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a general clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large. If some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controls for opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are more obscure. ",

After comparative analysis valuable data were obtained in the completeness of registration of literature and the efficiency of its reflection in different publications; on the types of classificatory schemes and intermediate instruments, on the quality of abstracts. The merits and drawbacks of basic bibliographic publications were shown, and recommendations for improving present bibliographic systems were suggested. ",

Results obtained on the example used, \"rehabilitation\" as cited in Index Medicus during  the years 1968-1971, were similar to those from five other fields, in that the  number of journals required for each percent gain in literature coverage  increased exponentially as the percentage of literature itself increased.  As  a consequence, library coverage of any particular field can be specified as a  function of its budgeting commitment, so that the maximum percent coverage will be obtained for each dollar spent. "

The purpose of this paper is to help clarify the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventional planning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narration of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and design of an actual library and information program.  The steps involved are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process.

It describes the system's background; its implementation in the federal government; its spread into non-federal sectors; and the system's methods, including systems analysis, applied economics, and quantitative reasoning.  The paper includes illustrative example of results needed for decision-making by managers, and basic guiding principles for PPBS application. ",

Its activities are designed to provide the Canadian scientific and industrial communities with direct and immediate access to the publications and information required in their day-to-day work.  Through co-operative measures with both national and international information agencies, the NSL serves as the focal point of a national scientific and technical information network.  The Library employs a variety of mechanized techniques to facilitate the storage, retrieval and dissemination of information.  During the past three years it has operated an SDI service using CT  and ISI tapes.  In November 1968 this SDI service, which had been limited to meeting the needs of approximately 170 scientists in the Ottawa area, was expanded to provide a national SDI service.  The author describes the evolution of these services from the local to national level, outlines basic techniques, describes the successes and failures of the system and indicates future developments.

These types are the SDI type, the intermediate type such as NASA's SCAN program, and the unselected type such as the usual library accession list.  A fourth type, the indexing and abstracting journal is defined but not related to the other three types.  The three current awareness publications are shown to have a relationship in terms of the number of requests they can produce from a given set of references or notices.  The SDI system will produce about one request from ten notices; the intermediate type about one request per hundred notices; ad the unselected type, one request per thousand notices.  Despite the differences in the number of notices to generate one request, the cost to produce one request is about the same for the three types of tools.  Also, the usage of these tools is related to the amount of user time available and a curve is presented based on various assumptions to define this relationship. ",

        "text": "   An application of location theory to the question of centralized versus decentralized library facilities for a university, with relevance for special  libraries is presented.  Locating university libraries near classrooms, offices, and dormitories requires a larger budget than combining these libraries into a  centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost to the university community which does not  appear in the university budget - a cost in time, energy, and decreased use resulting from locating the library a longer distance from users.  The analysis provides models for a single library, for two or more libraries, or for decentralized facilities. ",

        "text": "   The Information Dissemination Center has emerged as a broker or retailer for computer-based information retrieval services, interfacing with both the tape suppliers and with users of the search services.  Five areas which impact the center's interface with these two communities are discussed: the nature of the data bases which are available for search; retrieval results and factors which  affect them; the timeliness of services; costs and prices; and practical  operational considerations related to library interests.  Comparison shopping  between centers is advised as centers differ considerably in the services which are offered,  the data bases which are available, the experience of the information specialists who construct search profiles,  pricing structures which are used, and the prices which are charged.  Implications of the growing trend toward licensing and leasing information  resources, especially magnetic tape services, are discussed briefly. ",

Gibson Library's journal collection was conducted to determine 1) which journal titles could be discontinued, 2) which journal holdings could be moved to remote storage, and 3) which journal holdings could be converted to microfilm.  Totals were maintained for three areas of journal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used current  issues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by library  staff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles by  Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6%  reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additional  shelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of the accumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent to a remote storage area which is under construction.  The survey data have been and will continue to be consulted before any journals are converted to  microfilm. ",

It was found that manual searches are very time consuming  and, in our opinion, can better be done by persons with subject background. The machine searches furnished a  higher percentage of unrelated materials. However, little staff time is required to obtain them.  Lacking qualified persons to do literature searches, either in the library or in the research groups, greater use should be made of  the available computerized searches. ",

Their use of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.   Time and location factors play an important role in their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of the physicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching for information in the library.  Although libraries have been considered largely as storehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more  active roles for librarians are possible. ",

The formula     Ctotal = (T X Csum) + P is presented which captures all on-line cost factors.  A minimum cost of $1.00 per minute of on-line searching is derived.  Average searching time for manual searching is 22 hours at a total cost of $250; for on-line it is 45  minutes at total cost of $47.00.  It is pointed out that most reported low-on  line search costs fail to account for all cost factors. Figures are those prevailing at the time of writing. "

However, planning can only be carried out if the necessary statistical data and other information are available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 with the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for a survey of standards for library services currently recommended for libraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrusted to F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of North London School of Librarianship (United Kingdom). ",

As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography.   Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind.   My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization.   Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this count I offer no defense. "

The mathematics with which we are concerned is known as the theory of directed graphs, or more briefly as digraph theory.  It deals with abstract configurations called digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  When these terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematical models of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflect structural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematical terms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory has applicability to many different fields of investigation. ",

At that time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success.   Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant.  In some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place. ",

Thereby, in contrast to certain versions of Durkheim that teach that the objective reality of social facts is sociology's fundamental principle, the lesson is taken instead, and used as study policy, that the objective reality of social facts as an ongoing accomplishment of the concerted activities of daily life, with the ordinary, artful ways of that accomplishment being by members known, used, ad taken for granted, is, for members doing sociology, a fundamental phenomenon.  Because, and in the ways it is practical sociology's fundamental phenomenon, it is the prevailing topic for ethno-methodological study.

The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file.    While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown.    The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made.

These changes coincided with the publication of the results of the Cranfield project, which showed clearly that all indexing languages are basically the same.  However, although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was no one textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I felt was needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and its reception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill a real need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and - more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States, where British textbooks on classification had previously been regarded with something akin to suspicion.  (As the Dean of one American library school is alleged to have remarked, 'What theory of classification?') ",

The result is scarcely an adequate substitute for the book which Mr. Wells would have written.

In this country it has almost completely displaced the latter.  The principal classed catalogs    now remaining are those of the Engineering Societies Library in New York, the John Crerar Library in Chicago, and the Science and Technology Department of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  There are, nevertheless, many things to commend the classed catalog.  Rudolf Kaiser sums up the argument between the classed and the dictionary catalog by stating that a library needs both and explaining that the subject index fills the need as far as an alphabetical catalog is concerned.  However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.

It provides techniques useful in a wide variety of applications and helps develop a way of thinking that leads to understanding of the structure, behavior, and limitations and capabilities of logical machines.  In this book I have tried to cover the whole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to the more advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on the part of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniques for the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and to develop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems. For once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specific procedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter of engineering decisions. ",

It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects. ",

Probably at no prior point in the history of man has there been so much discussion about the rights and wrongs of the policy makers, whether they be the politicians in Albany or Sacramento, in Washington, Paris, or Moscow, the managers of far-flung industrial firms, or the people who run educational institutions.  In all cases the citizen feels a perfect right to have his say about the way in which the managers manage.   Not only has the citizen become far more vocal, but he has also in many instances begun to suspect that the people who make the major decisions that affect our lives don't know what they are doing.  They don't know what they are doing simply because they have no adequate basis to judge the effects of their decisions. "

        "text": "   Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during the last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action. ",

Classification of user groups and their demands:  to test a hypothesis; that it is possible to classify customers into meaningful user groups possessing recognizable common features and characteristic behavior patterns, and to classify group needs. 3. Estimation of the significance of the above for librarians: to measure the demand on librarians and libraries, in terms of expenditure of their time and skill, and use of stock made by different user groups.

Its basis is a body of survey data collected  from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of  colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is  considered in relation to the purposes of technical work..    While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of  information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied..    The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on  \"professional\" goals, i.e",

Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs  and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the needs of society..

An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed.. Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems..   Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are  discussed..    In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the  characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages..

        "title": " Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for Compact Storage ",
        "author": " Lister, Winston Charles ",
        "text": "    For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future..    To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the  criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage  quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials..    Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the  fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average  geometric pattern of obsolescence..    The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage  rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being  used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which  the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence,  although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite  distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon  the circulation activities of the individual libraries..    An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored..    Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation  where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit  relocation cost..    Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively  insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the  capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results;  and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules.. ",

        "text": "    Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines..  The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this  division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to  examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the  scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns..  These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library  systems..    Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..    One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"title dispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has  resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..    The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and  evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in  determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives..    The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was  collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D.  dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed  and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..    This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between  disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems.. ",

        "text": "    Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous  problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability,  storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems  is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and  advantages..    The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori  automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is  demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document  descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and  one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the  indexing method used..    It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the  aforementioned file..    The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a  file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation.. ",

Letters and reports get locked away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else can claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and the advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes from participation in an important investigation finished as an influential and well-written book.

As the magnitude and complexity of the available information has continued to increase, investigators have examined means of reducing the costly and time-consuming processes involved when human beings assign index terms to documents.  Recognition of the general inadequacy of present indexing, and concern over time and cost factors in index preparation have prompted experimentation in the development and application of machines to assist in the indexing process.  As a result, use of suitable mechanized or partly mechanized procedures to replace or complement the manual indexing process has become more widespread.  Machine indexing is a process whereby mechanized or automatic selection or generation of indexing terms is accomplished.  The present study investigates one aspect of automatic computer-based indexing, the permuted title index. ",

They centre on the recovery of records according to their subject matter.   Since libraries began, librarians have evolved, studied, and taught procedures for indexing and classifying.  These allow some delegation from subject specialists who understand the subject matter, to library staff who can recognize the ways in which specialists talk about it.  The procedures consider mostly only the interpretation of texts, not the text itself as an object with recognizable marks subject to the laws of physics and the principles of engineering. They assume the problems of topic identification solved, and the methods for recovering physical texts as independent of the methods for describing the interpretations of texts. "

An effort has been made to discover and to point out the strong and weak points in the organization of these library schools and in the training which they offer.  Many of the defects disclosed could be remedied by the schools themselves; others are due to extreme poverty and can be remedied only by increased income. ",

        "text": "     The development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the modern university campus is a recent innovation - so recent, in fact, that in September, 1965, there were only six such libraries in the United States. The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation of these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin.  As early as 1608, when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, \"he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  But Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed.\"  So it is to Harvard that we turn for an  example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight.     Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important, they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research.     The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out, missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.  The university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work. ",

With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal  encyclopedia.  Education by classified data has been the Western program ever since.   Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM.  When data moves instantly, classification is too fragmentary.  In order to cope with data at electric speed in typical situations of \"information overload,\" men resort to the study of configurations, like the sailor in Edgar Allan Poe's Maelstrom.   \"The medium is the message\" means, in terms of the electronic age, that a totally new environment has been created.  The \"content\" of this new environment is the old mechanized environment of the industrial age. ",

However, Winograd's \"Program for Understanding Natural Language\" seems sufficiently general and important in its implications to warrant the experiment.  Some readers will find sufficient the first two sections, which present, respectively, an overview of the system and what it does, and a first-rate evaluation of research in artificial intelligence on natural language processing, semantics, and theorem proving. Others will want to explore in detail the structure of the syntactic component, the treatment of semantics, and the programming language for specifying theories of problem solving.  Each of these contributions is significant in its own right.  Together they form a unique, integrated system capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the information contained in complex natural language discourse. ",

In examining these criticisms and some special schemes an effort is made here to elucidate those features of the UDC which prevent it from being more widely used and then to suggest how the UDC might be developed to provide the facilities needed.

New journals in specialized branches of  science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of  volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject  areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for  publication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the  developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research  libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking  of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective  countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist.. This method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries  by changing the citing journals according to their country's needs.. ",

The fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression, on the one hand, and with technological improvements in means of dissemination, on the other.  Successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the publisher, and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is this striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, at present, and for the future, which constitutes the central theme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered by Professor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University School of Law in March, 1966.

This book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library services.

When librarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic control was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community - which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others  overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der  Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception. ",

It is not longer of any interest to describe one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance of the facts to general linguistic theory.  As Ross put it, it makes no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own structure alone.'  Toward the end of the conference, when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model, the question was raised:  What should we be teaching our students?  Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt: We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light - negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general are like.

However, the research reported herein is a preliminary attempt to understand and define some basic problems that must be solved  if computers are ever to aid the historian of science - no less supplant him. In this study, it was necessary to select a recent important scientific breakthrough which was based on the cumulation of years of diverse scientific achievement.  For this reason we selected the discovery of the DNA code.  For a concise historical description of the events, we then selected \"The Genetic Code,\" a book by Dr. Isaac Asimov which describes the major scientific developments that eventually led to the duplication in the laboratory of the process of protein synthesis under control of DNA.

The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of a long-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, or operationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the question of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user requirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in both areas of concern. "

This volume is primarily concerned with the government- business relationships within which these activities take place. Our title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined to include the conception, development, and production of technically advanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of government agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs.   The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of these facets of weapons development and production.  Such an objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than administrative study.  Yet most social science research,  however \"pure\" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public policy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a specific set of public policy recommendations.  Rather, it is largely limited to providing understanding - a prerequisite to criticism, debate, revision, and improvement. ",

However, it became apparent that the principles and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library  collections.     This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes:     1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and serious research in the field of weeding.  The author's own research is  reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study.     2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for \"weeding without tears.\"     3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one  of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful  collections.     4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of circulation and in user satisfaction.

Its basic idea is to use letter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbers to express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings. These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end of the molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, ever since structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphic symbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply an extension and standardization of this practice. ",

I was impressed by the large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part, this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used to study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent theoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be highly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardization of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes underlying empirical data. ",

In the first book, Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, my colleagues and I attempted to review and systematize what had been gleaned from research and contemplation after a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to Work that followed, we described an original research study that offered a completely new hypothesis about the way people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have taken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory of Work and the Nature of Man.\tWhile the trilogy contains the three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge of what has gone before, new research and finally a theory, the task that I set out for myself many years ago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.   That task was to give original substance to the new  discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible, to make some positive contributions. ",

As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and  organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing aspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observe that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets of the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the many actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total consequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are coming to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important than the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as one step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from mutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural subsystems. "

The intention of the present work is to examine some of the implications of this rapid growth in the number of library schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed, and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo- American library education, while at the same time examining other major patterns of professional education for librarians which exist in the world, and comparing these with the approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has been made to trace the influences which the British and America systems of library education have had, particularly in the developing countries. ",

Its recognition of the possibility that invention might require encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is desirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum. This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry into the soundness of the supposition.
